These are the most important known problems with VICE 0.14.0:

- The custom TextField widget is buggy and can cause crashes on
  DEC/Alpha machines, and possibly on other systems too.  If you get
  weird X protocol errors or the file selector makes the emulator die
  when you close it, this might be the cause.  In that case, recompile
  with the `--disable-textfield' option.  If it still does not work,
  please tell us.

- Setting a maximum speed limit does not always work because of
  limited timer resolution on many systems.

- P00 file name handling is not exact, as you must use the file system
  name (with the P00 extension) instead of the one specified in the
  P00 format, or attach them as tape images.

- GCR writes to disk images in full 1541 emulation mode are not 100%
  emulated (the provided emulation should be enough for most purposes,
  though).

- There is no support for wildcards on the FS drive access, but they
  can be used when reading the directory (eg. LOAD"$:gamez/*.p00",8).

- The VIC-I chip in xvic still lacks important features and is still
  under construction.

- The CRTC chip in xpet only supports the basic features and is still
  under construction.

- Unlike the CIAs in the C64, the VIAs in the PET, VIC20 and 1541
  emulators are _not_ cycle-exact.

- xvic and xpet do not support tape images.

- The C64 and VIC20 cartridge ROMs are not emulated.

- Changing the REU image name via resource files has no effect until
  exiting.

- Dithering on monochrome X11 servers is *very* slow.

- When a key which is shifted on the real machine but unshifted on the
  PC or Unix keyboard you are using is pressed, the virtual shift is
  pressed together (i.e. at the same clock cycle) with the main key;
  this could not work with some keyboard routines.  If you have to
  use the function keys, press the (real) shift key manually (e.g. F2
  = Shift + F1, F4 = Shift + F3 and so on); this also works with other
  keys.

- Adaptive sound speed is not supported on MS-DOS.
