These are the most important known problems with VICE 1.7:

- Some basic features of the VDC are missing. In the MS-DOS port you
  have to save the configuration and restart the emulator when
  changing VDC double size mode.

- In the C128 emulation VIC-II and VDC palette can not coexist
  currently in some ports.

- The Z80 emulation is not complete.  Some CP/M applications and ZP/M
  may not work.

- The VIC-II implementation lacks proper cycle exact $D016 x smooth
  scroll support.

- The CBM-II emulation is not fully supported in all ports.

- When loading a snapshot, the monitor break/watchpoints break.
  (at least in xpet)

- The German translation doesn't work properly under
  Solaris/gettext. The menus are just partially filled, other entries
  are blanked and some are wrong.

- The custom TextField widget is buggy and can cause crashes on
  DEC/Alpha machines, and possibly on other systems too.  If you get
  weird X protocol errors or the file selector makes the emulator die
  when you close it, this might be the cause.  In that case, recompile
  with the `--disable-textfield' option.  If it still does not work,
  please tell us.

- Some DEC/Alpha machines crash due to the XAW implementation.  Compile
  VICE with GNOME support `--enable-gnomeui' instead.

- The VIC-I chip in xvic still lacks important features and is still
  under construction.

- Changing the REU image name via resource files has no effect until
  exiting.

- Dithering on monochrome X11 servers is *very* (VERY!) slow.

- When a key which is shifted on the real machine but unshifted on the
  PC or Unix keyboard you are using is pressed, the virtual shift is
  pressed together (i.e. at the same clock cycle) with the main key;
  this could not work with some keyboard routines.  If you have to
  use the function keys, press the (real) shift key manually (e.g. F2
  = Shift + F1, F4 = Shift + F3 and so on); this also works with other
  keys.

- The CBM-II emulator, when the execution bank is set to an open memory
  bank, sets the zeropage and stack access to unmapped, but actually
  existing memory. This is a bug but cannot be avoided with the current
  CPU code architecture.

- When running the burn-in and diagnostics test of the 8296 system disk
  on "xpet -model 8296" a lot of stuff fails.

- Although both are emulated in the xcbm2 emulator, switching between
  C510 and C6x0/7x0 is not possible at runtime. Use command line option
  "xcbm -model 510".

- Dual disk drive 2040/3040 support (DOS1, 670 blocks free) is not working 

- In the C510 emulation the VIC-II timing is not exact, i.e. the
  stopping of the CPU during bad lines is wrong.
