It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE, but
please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the
team.

- Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you use
  M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off the
  "rich text" (HTML) feature.

- Please don't send any binaries without asking first.

- Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a bug
  or a problem you cannot solve:

   - the VICE documentation (you should have received it with the main
     distribution--if not, tell us);

   - the VICE FAQ (available from the VICE homepage at
     http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fachat/vice/vice.html);

   - the comp.emulators.cbm and comp.sys.cbm FAQs (available from many
     places; one famous repository is at ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/).

- When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
  describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should
  also tell us what machine you are running on, what operating system
  you are using as well as the version of it.

- Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to
  your PC.  To transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander
  (http://ludens.elte.hu/~sta/sc.html).

- Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
  Internet.

- Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
  really don't know.

- Please write in English, or in the native language of the person you
  are writing to (Ettore is Italian, André and Andreas are German,
  Teemu is Finnish, Daniel is from Canada).

In any case, we would be really glad to receive your comments about
VICE.

Thanks!
