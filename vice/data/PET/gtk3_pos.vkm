# VICE keyboard mapping file

# 2001, 3032 and 4032 use graphics keyboard
# 4032B, 8032 and up use business keyboard

# this file is a fallback that will be used when no other keymap exists. due to
# the different types of keyboards that exist for the PET family, this will not
# work for all of them (only the "big" machines).

# use PET business mapping as base
