Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  675
Mass Ave, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Preamble
========


   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
 
   When we speak of free software, we are
referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies
of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you
know you can do these things.
 
   To protect your rights, we need to
make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to
ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.
 
   For example, if you distribute
copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give
the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show
them these terms so they know their
 rights.
 
   We protect your
rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you
this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute
and/or modify the software.
 
   Also, for each author's protection
and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that
there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is
modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors'
reputations.
 
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly
by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors
of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it
clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
licensed at all.
 
   The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and
 modification follow.
 
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a
"work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the
term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The
act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output
from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a
work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.
 
 You
may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any
change.

b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
or any
 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
to all third
 parties under the terms of this License.

c. If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively
 when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such
 interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an
 announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a
 notice that there is no
warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under
 these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
but
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work
based on
 the Program is not required to print an
announcement.)

 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as
separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as
part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
 
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim
rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the
Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not
based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on
the Program) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.


3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:
a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable
 source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
your
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
code, to be
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium
 customarily used for software
interchange; or,

c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the
offer
 to distribute corresponding source code.  (This
alternative is
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution
and only if you
 received the program in object code or
executable form with such
 an offer, in accord with
Subsection b above.)

 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work,
complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules
it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of
the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source
code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself
accompanies the executable.
 
 If distribution of executable or
object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated
place, then offering equivalent
 access to copy the source code
from the same place counts as
 distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under
 this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.


5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These
actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to
 this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this
License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not
distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to
apply in other
 circumstances.
 
 It is not the purpose of this
section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property
right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the
free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by
public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through
that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 
 This section is
intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case,
this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.  If the
Program does not specify a version number of
 this License, you
may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision
will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.
 
                               NO WARRANTY


11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================


   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is
to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change
under these terms.
 
   To do so, attach the following notices to the
program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source
file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each
file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where
the full notice is found.
ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
paper mail.
 
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short
notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
 the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
`show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.
 
 You should also get your employer (if you work
as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright
disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter
the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may
 consider it more useful to permit linking
proprietary applications with the
 library.  If this is what you want
to do, use the GNU Library General
 Public License instead of this
License.

2 About VICE
************


 VICE is the one and only "Versatile Commodore Emulator".  It
provides
 emulation of the Commodore C64, C64DTV, C128, VIC20, PET,
PLUS4 and CBM-II computers
 within a single package.  The emulators
run as separate programs, but have
 the same user interface, share the
same settings and support the same
 file formats.
 
 *Important
notice:* If you have no idea what a Commodore
 8-bit computer is, or
have questions about how these machines are used,
 how the file
formats work or anything else that is not strictly
 related to VICE,
you should read the appropriate FAQs _first_, as
 that kind of
information is not available here.  *Note Contacts::. for
 information
about how to retrieve the FAQs.
 
 All the emulators provide an
accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with emulation
 of all the opcodes (both
documented and undocumented ones) and accurate
 timing.  Unlike other
emulators, VICE aims to be cycle
 accurate; it tries to emulate chip
timings as precisely as possible and
 does so _efficiently_.
Please do _not_ expect the C64DTV, C128, PET, PLUS4 and CBM-II
emulators to
 be as good as the C64 or VIC20 one, as they are still
under construction.
 
 _Notice:_ This documentation is written for
the Unix release of VICE.
 
 

2.1 C64 emulator features
=========================


 As of version 2.3, two C64 emulators are provided: `x64' (fast)
and `x64sc' (accurate).
 
 The fast C64 emulator, called `x64',
features a fairly complete
 emulation of the VIC-II video chip:
sprites, all registers and all video
 modes are fully emulated.  The
emulation has been fully cycle-accurate
 since version 0.13.0.
The accurate C64 emulator, called `x64sc', features a cycle-based
 and
pixel-accurate VIC-II emulation. This requires a much faster machine
than the old `x64'.
 
 A rather complete emulation of the SID sound
chip is also provided.  All
 the basic features are implemented as
well as most of the complex ones
 including synchronisation, ring
modulation and filters.  There are three
 emulators of the SID chip
available: first is the "standard" VICE
 emulator, available since
VICE 0.12; the second is Dag Lem's reSID
 engine and the third one is
reSID-fp. The reSID engines are a lot more 
 accurate than the
standard engine, but they are also a lot slower, and 
 only suitable
for faster machines.
 
 Naturally, also both CIAs (or VIAs, in some
cases) are fully emulated
 and cycle accurate.
 

2.2 C64DTV emulator features
============================


 The C64DTV emulator, called `x64dtv', features emulation of C64DTV
revisions 2 and 3. The emulator is under construction, but most of the
DTV specific features are already supported (with varying accuracy).

 Video cache is disabled by default as it currently doesn't work
with
 some of C64DTV's new video modes. The new video modes have a
simple
 "fake" video cache implementation that may give incorrect
results
 and decreased performance.
 

2.3 C128 emulator features
==========================


 The C128 emulator, called `x128', features a complete emulation of
the internal MMU ("Memory Management Unit"), 80 column VDC screen,
fast
 IEC bus emulation, 2 MHz mode, Z80 emulation plus all the
features of the 
 C64 emulation.
 

2.4 VIC20 emulator features
===========================


 The VIC20 emulates all the internal hardware, including the VIA
chips.
 The VIC-I video chip is fully emulated except NTSC interlace
mode, so most 
 graphical effects will work correctly.
 
 Sound
support is implemented, but is still at an experimental stage.  If
you think it could be improved and know how to do so, feel
 free to
contact us (*note Contacts::).
 
 The VIC20 emulator now allows the
use of the VIC1112 IEEE488 
 interface. You have to enable the
hardware (by menu, resource, or
 commandline option) and then load the
IEEE488 ROM (see for 
 example
`http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/vic20/ieee-488/325329-04.bin',
but you have to double the size to 4k for now).
 The IEEE-488 code is
then started by `SYS45065'.
 

2.5 PET emulator features
=========================


 The PET emulator emulates the 2001, 3032, 4032, 8032, 8096, 8296
and
 SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) models, covering practically the
whole series.
 The hardware is pretty much the same in each and that
is why one single
 program is enough to emulate all of them.  For more
detailed information
 about PET hardware please refer to the `PETdoc'
file.
 
 Both the 40 column and 80 column CRTC video chips are
emulated (from the
 4032 onward), but a few of the features are not
implemented yet (numbers
 of rasterlines per char and lines per
screen).  Fortunately, they are
 not very important for average
applications.
 
 Sound is available for the PET as well, but like the
VIC20's it is still
 under construction.
 
 The PET 8096 is
basically a PET 8032 with a 64k extension board which
 allows
remapping the upper 32k with RAM.  You have to write to a special
register at `$fff0' to remap the memory.  The PET 8296 is a
 8096 but
with a completely redesigned motherboard with 128k RAM in
 total.  Of
the additional 32k RAM you can use only some in blocks of 4k,
 but you
have to set jumpers on the motherboard for it.  VICE uses the
 command
line options `-petram9' and `-petramA'
 instead.  Also, the video
controller can handle a larger address range.
 The PET 8x96 model
emulations run the Commodore LOS-96 operating system
 - basically an
improved BASIC 4 version with up to 32k for BASIC
 text and 32k for
variables.  See `PETdoc' for more information.
 
 The SuperPET also
is a PET 8032 with an expansion board.  It can map 4k
 at a time out
of 64k into the `$9***' area.  Also it has an ACIA
 6551 for RS232
communication.  The 6809 that is built into the SuperPET
 is not
emulated, though.
 
 The PET computers came with three major ROM
revisions, so-called BASIC
 1, 2 and 4, all of which are provided.
The PET 2001 uses the version 1,
 the PET 3032 uses version 2, and the
others use version 4.  The 2001 ROM
 is horribly broken with respect
to IEEE488 (they shipped it before they
 tested it with the floppy
drive, so only tape worked.  Therefore the
 emulator patches the ROM
to fix the IEEE488 routines.
 
 As well as other low-level fixes the
2001 patch obtains the load address
 for a program file from the first
two bytes of the file.  This allows
 the loading of both PET2001-saved
files (that have $0400 as their load
 address) and other PET files
(that have $0401).  The PET2001 saves from
 $0400 and not from $0401
as other PETs do.
 
 Moreover, the secondary addresses used are now
`0' and `1' for
 load and save, respectively, and not arbitrary unused
secondary
 addresses.
 
 To select which model to run, specify it on
the
 command line with the `-model MODEL' option, where
 `MODEL' can
be one of a list of PET model numbers, all
 described in *note PET
model::
 

2.6 CBM-II emulator features
============================


 The CBM-II emulator emulates several types of CBM-II models.  Those
models are known under different names in the USA and Europe.  In the
States they have been sold as `B128' and `B256', in Europe as
 `CBM
610', `CBM 620' (low-profile case) or `CBM 710' and
 `CBM 720'
(high-profile case with monitor). In addition to that
 now an
experimental C510 emulation is included. The C510 (also known as
P500) is the little brother of the C600/700 machines. It runs at
roughly
 1 MHz and, surprise, it has a VIC-II instead of the CRTC.
Otherwise
 the different line of computers are very similar.
These computers are prepared to take a coprocessor board with an 8088
or
 Z80 CPU.  Indeed there are models `CBM 630' and `CBM 730' that
supposedly had those processors.  However these models are not
emulated.
 
 The basic difference is the amount of RAM these machines
have been
 supplied with.  The `B128' and the `CBM *10' models had
128k
 RAM, the others 256k. This implies some banking scheme, as the
6502 can
 only address 64k.  And indeed those machines use a 6509,
that can
 address 1 MByte of RAM.  It has 2 registers at addresses 0
and 1.  The
 indirect bank register at address 1 determines the bank
(0-15) where the
 opcodes `LDA (zp),Y' and `STA (zp),Y' take the data
from.  The
 exec bank register at address 0 determines the bank where
all other read
 and write addresses take place.
 
 The business line
machines (C6xx/7xx) have the RAM in banks 1-2, resp.
 1-4. All
available banks are used for BASIC, where program code is separated
from all variables, resp. from normal variables, strings and arrays
that
 are distributed over other banks. The C510 instead has RAM in
banks 0 and 1,
 and uses bank 1 for program and all variables. Bank 0,
though, can be 
 accessed by the VIC-II to display graphics.
 
 Many
models have been expanded to more than the built-in memory.  In fact
some machines have been expanded to the full 1M.  Bank 15 is used as
system bank, with only little RAM, and lots of expansion cartridge ROM
area, the I/O and the kernal/basic ROMs.  Some models have been
modified
 to map RAM into the expansion ROM area.  Those modifications
can be
 emulated as well.
 
 The different settings are described in
*note CBM-II model::.

2.7 The keyboard emulation
==========================


 There are two ways of emulating the keyboard in VICE.
 
 The
default way ("symbolic mapping") is to map every key
 combination to
the corresponding key combination on the real machine:
 for example,
if you press <*>, which is bound to `Shift-8' on a
 U.S. keyboard, in
the C64 emulator, the emulated machine will have just
 the _unshifted_
<*> key pressed (as <*> is unshifted on the
 C64 keyboard).  Likewise,
pressing <'> on the same U.S. keyboard
 without any shift key will
cause the combination `Shift-7' to be
 pressed in the emulated C64.
This way, it becomes quite obvious what
 keys should be typed to
obtain all the symbols.
 
 There is, however, one problem with
symbolic mapping: some keys really
 need to be mapped specially
regardless.  The most important examples
 being, in the VIC20, C64 and
C128 emulators, that <CTRL> is mapped
 to <Tab> and that the
<Commodore> key is mapped to the left
 <Control>). The <RUN/STOP> key
is mapped to the <ESC> key
 on the PC keyboard. The PET emulator,
lacking the <Commodore> key
 but having an <ESC> key, uses the left
<Control> key as
 <RUN/STOP> and the <ESC> key as <ESC> of course.

 The second way ("positional mapping") is to map every key on the
"real" keyboard to the key which has the same position on the keyboard
of the emulated machine.  This way, no <Shift> key is forced by the
program (with the exception of the function keys <F2>, <F4>,
 <F6> and
<F8>, which require <Shift> on the Commodore
 keyboards), and the
keyboard is more comfortable to use in those
 programs (such as some
games) that require the keys to be in the correct
 positions.
*Warning:* unlike the real C64, VICE "presses" the <Shift>
 key
_together_ with the key to shift when the <Shift> must be
 forced.  In
most cases this should work fine, but some keyboard routines
 are
quite picky and tend not to recognize the shift key because of this.
For instance, `F6' (which on the real C64 is obtained with
 `Shift +
F5') could be recognized as `F5'.  In that case, use
 the shift key
manually (i.e., type `Shift + F5' in the example).
 Yes, we know this
is a bug.
 
 The `RESTORE' key is mapped to `Page Up' (or `Prev') by
default.
 

2.8 The joystick emulation
==========================


 Joysticks can be emulated both via the keyboard and via a real
joystick
 connected to the host machine (the latter only works on
GNU/Linux
 systems).
 
 There are two keyboard layouts for joystick
use, known as "numpad"
 and "custom".
 
 The "numpad" layout uses
the numeric keypad keys, i.e., the numbers
 <1>...<9> which emulate
all the directions including the
 diagonal ones; <0> emulates the fire
button.
 
 The "custom" layout uses the keys <w>, <e>, <r>,
 <s>,
<d>, <f>, <x>, <c>, <v> for the directions
 and <space> for the fire
button instead.
 

2.9 The disk drive emulation
============================


 All the emulators support up to 4 external disk drives as
 devices
8, 9, 10 and 11.  Each of these devices can emulate virtual
 Commodore
1541, 1541-II, 1571, 1581, 2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and
8250 drives in one of four ways:
* using disk images, i.e., files that contain a dump of all the
blocks
 contained in a real floppy disk (if you want more
information about
 what a disk image is, consult the
`comp.emulators.cbm' FAQ);

* accessing file system directories, thus giving you the use of
files
 without having to copy them to disk images; this also
allows you to
 read and write files in the `P00' format (again,
consult the
 `comp.emulators.cbm' FAQ for more info).

* accessing a real device connected to the host machine. As of VICE
1.11
 it is possible to connect real drives like Commodore 1541
to the
 printer port of the host using the XA1541 or XM1541
cable. Currently
 this only works on Linux or Windows using the
OpenCBM library. You can
 get it from
http://www.lb.shuttle.de/puffin/cbm4linux (cbm4linux,
 Linux
version) or from http://cbm4win.sf.net/ (cbm4win, Windows
version).

* directly using the disk drive of the host. The 3.5" disk drive of
the
 host can be used to read or write Commodore 1581 formatted
disks.
 Currently this raw drive access feature is only available
for Linux
 hosts.

 When using disk images there are two available types of drive
emulation.  One of them the "virtual drive" emulation.  It does
 _not_
really emulate the serial line, but patches the kernal ROM
 (with the
so-called "kernal traps") so that serial line operations
 can be
emulated via C language routines.  This emulation is very fast,
 but
only allows use of standard DOS functions (and not even all of
 them).
For real device or raw drive access it is required to enable
 this
type of emulation.
 
 The IEEE488 drives (2031, 2040, 3040, 4040,
1001, 8050 and 8250) do
 not use kernal traps. Instead the IEEE488
interface lines are
 monitored and the data is passed to the drive
emulation. To use them
 on the C64, you need to enable the IEEE488
interface emulation. Only
 if the IEEE488 emulation is enabled, those
drives can be selected.
 
 The other alternative is a "true drive"
emulation.  The
 Commodore disk drives are provided with their own CPU
(a 6502 as the
 VIC20 and the PETs) and their own RAM and ROM.  So, in
order to more
 closely emulate its features, a complete emulation of
this hardware
 must be provided and that is what the "hardware level"
emulation
 does. When the "hardware level" emulation is used, the
kernal
 routines are remain unpatched and the serial line is fully
emulated.
 The problem with this emulation is that it needs a lot of
processing
 power, mainly because the emulator has to emulate two CPUs
instead of
 one.
 
 The PETs do not use a serial IEC bus to
communicate with the floppy
 drive but instead use the parallel
IEEE488 bus.  This does
 _byte by byte_ transfers, as opposed to the
_bit by bit_
 transfers of the C64 and VIC20, so making it feasible to
emulate the
 parallel line completely while emulating the drive at DOS
level only.
 The IEEE488 line interpreter maps the drives 8-11 (as
described
 above) to the IEEE488 disk units, and no kernal traps are
needed.
 The same emulation of the Commodore IEEE488 bus interface is
available for the C64 and the VIC20. With IEEE488 drives you can have
true 2031 emulation at unit #8, and still have filesystem access at
units #10 or #11, because monitoring the IEEE488 lines does not
interfere with the true drive emulation.
 
 The IEEE488 disk drives
3040, 4040, 8050 and 8250 are Dual Drive
 Floppy Disks. This means
that these drives handle two disks. To
 Accomplish the emulation, only
one disk can be emulated, namely unit
 #8. The attached image, track
display and LED display of unit #9 are
 used for the second drive of
the dual disk drives. On unix the unit
 number display (8 or 9) in the
emulation window changes to the drive
 number display (0 or 1).
The Commodore 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250 disk drives are
so-called "old-style" disk drives. Their architecture includes not
one, but two processors of the 6502 type, namely a 6502 for the file
handling and communication with the PET (IP), and a 6504 (which is a
6502 with reduced address space) for the drive handling (FDC). Both
processors communicate over a shared memory area. The IP writes
commands to read/write blocks to this area and the FDC executes them.
To make the emulation feasible, the FDC processor is not emulated
cycle-exactly as a 6504, but simply by checking the commands and
executing them on the host. This provides a fast FDC emulation, but
disallows the sending the FDC processor commands to execute code.
Applications where this is necessary are believed to be rather
seldom. Only the format command uses this feature, but this is
checked for.
 
 The dual disk drive 2040 emulates one of the very
first CBM disk
 drives. This drive has DOS version 1. DOS1 uses an own
disk type,
 that is closely related to the 1541 disk image. Only on
tracks 18-24
 DOS1 disks have a sector more than 1541 disks. DOS1 disk
images have
 the extension .d67.
 
 The dual disk drives 3040 and
4040 use the same logical disk format
 as the VC1541 and the 2031. In
fact, the 4040 was the first disk with
 DOS version 2. The 3040
emulated here originally was the same as
 2040, only for the european
30xx PET series. As many of the original
 DOS1 disk drives were
upgraded (a simple ROM upgrade!) to DOS2, I use
 the 3040 number for a
DOS 2.0 disk drive, and 4040 for a revised DOS
 2 disk drive. It is,
however, not yet clear whether the disks here
 are write compatible to
the 1541, as rumors exist that the write gap
 between  sectors is
different. But read compatible they are. As VICE
 emulates the FDC
processor in C and not as 6504 emulation, this does
 not matter in
VICE.
 
 The drives 1001, 8050 and 8250 do actually have the very
same DOS
 ROM. Only the code in the FDC is different, which is taken
care of by
 VICE. So for all three of those disk drives, only
`dos1001' is
 needed. The DOS version used is 2.7.

2.10 Supported file formats
===========================


 VICE supports the most popular Commodore file formats:


* `X64' (preferred) or `D64' disk image files; Used by the 1541,
2031, 3040, 4040 drives.

* `G64' GCR-encoded 1541 disk image files;

* `D67' CBM2040 (DOS1) disk image format

* `D71' VC1571 disk image format

* `D81' VC1581 disk image format

* `D80' CBM8050 disk image format

* `D82' CBM8250/1001 disk image format

* `T64' tape image files (read-only);

* `P00' program files;

 An utility (`c1541', *note c1541::) is provided to allow
transfers
 and conversions between these formats.
 
 Notice that the
use of the `X64' file format is depreciated now.
 
 You can convert
an `X64' file back into a `D64' file with the
 UNIX `dd' command:
dd bs=64 skip=1 if=IMAGE.X64 of=IMAGE.D64

 *Note File formats::. for a technical description of the
supported file
 formats.

2.11 Common problems
====================


 This section tries to describe the most common known problems with
VICE,
 and how to resolve them.
 

2.11.1 Sound problems
---------------------


 VICE should compile and run without major problems on many UNIX
systems,
 but there are some known issues related to the sound driver.
In fact,
 the sound code is the least portable part of the emulator
and has not
 yet been thoroughly tested on all the supported
platforms.
 
 Linux, AIX and SGI systems should play sound without
any problems; if
 you are running Linux please use a 2.x kernel, as
VICE needs some
 features that were not implemented in older versions
of the Linux sound
 driver.
 
 On the other hand, HP-UX and Solaris
machines are known to cause
 troubles.  If you think you can help
debugging the code for these
 systems, your help would be really
appreciated.  We are having troubles
 finding HP-UX and SUN consoles
to work at...
 
 Some problems have been reported with the
proprietary version of the
 Open Sound System for Linux.  With a
Crystal sound card, sound output
 was significantly delayed and,
apparently, the allocated buffer size was 
 completely wrong.  This is
not a VICE bug, but rather an OSS bug.
 

2.11.2 Shared memory problems
-----------------------------


 If you cannot start VICE because you get errors about shared memory,
try
 to run it with the `+mitshm' command-line option (*note Video
options::).  This will completely disable usage of the MITSHM
extensions,
 that are normally used to speed up the emulation window
updates.  Of
 course, this will also result in a big loss in speed.

 Reasons for this failure could be:
* IPC support has been disabled at the system level; some system
administrators disable this for security reasons.  If _you_ are
the
 system administrator, use a kernel that has IPC support
compiled in and
 enabled.

* You are attempting to run the emulator across the network (i.e.,
the
 emulator runs on one machine, and the output is displayed on
another
 machine that works as an X terminal) and for some reason
VICE does not
 recognize this fact.  In this case, you have found
a bug, so please report it
 to us.

 If you want to avoid running the emulator with `+mitshm' every
time, run it once with `+mitshm' and then choose "Save settings"
 from
the right-button menu.

2.11.3 Printer problems
-----------------------


 VICE supports the emulation of a printer either on the userport or
as 
 IEC device 4. Unfortunately the Commodore IEC routines do not
send all commands to the IEC bus. For example an `OPEN 1,4'
 is not
seen on the IEC bus. Also a `CLOSE 1' after that
 is not seen. VICE
can see from printing that there was an `OPEN',
 but it cannot see
when the close was. Also a "finish print job" 
 cannot be seen on the
userport device.
 To flush the printer buffer (write to `print.dump'
or to the 
 printer) now a menu entry can be used. Disabling and
re-enabling the printer
 should work as well.
 
 The printing
services have not been extensively tested but apart
 from the problem
mentioned above it should work fine now.

2.11.4 PET keyboard problems
----------------------------


 If you find that the German keyboard mapping (plus German charset)
does not print uppercase umlauts, then you are right. 
 The umlauts
replace the [, and ] characters in the charset. The keys
 that make
these characters do not have a different entry in the 
 PET editor ROM
tables when shifted.
 Thus it is not possible to get the uppercase
umlauts in the editor.
 Nevertheless other programs are reported to
change the keyboard
 mapping table and thus allow the use of the
shifted (uppercase) umlauts.
 
 Anyway, the VICE keyboard mappings
are far from being perfect and we are open
 to any suggestions.

3 Invoking the emulators
************************


 The names of the available emulators are:


* `x64', the fast C64 emulator

* `x64sc', the accurate C64 emulator

* `x64dtv', the C64DTV emulator

* `x128', the C128 emulator

* `xvic', the VIC20 emulator

* `xpet', the PET emulator

* `xplus4', the PLUS4 emulator

* `xcbm2', the CBM-II emulator

 You can run each of them by simply typing the name from a shell.
If you
 want to run them from another application (e.g., a window
manager or
 some other sort of program launcher) you should always run
them from a
 terminal window such as `xterm' or `rxvt' since VICE
provides
 a lot of debugging information that is sent to the terminal
and has
 built-in monitor that also appears there.  For example, you
could do
xterm -e x64

 

3.1 Command-line options used during initialization
===================================================


 There are several options you can specify on the command line.  Some
of
 them are used to specify emulation settings and will be described
in
 detail later (*note Settings and resources:: for a complete list).
The
 remaining options are used only to give usage information or to
initialize the emulator in some way:
`-help'
`-?'
List all the available command-line options and their meaning.

`-default'
Set default resources (*note Settings and resources::).  This
will
 override all the settings specified before, but not the
settings
 specified afterwards on the command line.

`-config <filename>'
Specify config file

`-logfile <name>'
Specify log file name

`-verbose'
Enable verbose log output.

`-keybuf <string>'
Put the specified string into the keyboard buffer.

`-console'
Console mode (for music playback)

`-chdir <directory>'
Change the working directory.

`-autostart IMAGE'
Autostart `IMAGE' (*note Command-line autostart::).

`-autoload <name>'
Attach and autoload tape/disk image <name>

`-basicload'
On autostart, load to BASIC start (without ',1')

`+basicload'
On autostart, load with ',1'

`-autostartwithcolon'
On autostart, use the 'RUN' command with a colon, i.e., 'RUN:'

`+autostartwithcolon'
On autostart, do not use the 'RUN' command with a colon; i.e.,
'RUN'

`-autostart-handle-tde'
`+autostart-handle-tde'
Handle/Do not handle True Drive Emulation on autostart

`+autostart-warp'
Enable/Disable warp mode during autostart

`-autostartprgmode'
Set autostart mode for PRG files

`-autostartprgdiskimage'
Set disk image for autostart of PRG files
 

`-1 NAME'
Attach `NAME' as a tape image file.

`-8 NAME'
`-9 NAME'
`-10 NAME'
`-11 NAME'
Attach `NAME' as a disk image to device 8, 9, 10 or 11.
 

`-attach8ro'
`-attach9ro'
`-attach10ro'
`-attach11ro'
Attach disk image for drive #8-11 read only

`-attach8rw'
`-attach9rw'
`-attach10rw'
`-attach11rw'
Attach disk image for drive #8-11 read write (if possible)


3.2 Autostarting programs from the command-line
===============================================


 It is possible to let the emulator "autostart" a disk or tape image
file, by simply specifying its name as the _last_ argument on the
command line, for example
x64 lovelygame.x64.gz

 will start the C64 emulator, attaching `lovelygame.x64.gz' as a
disk image and running the first program on it.  You can also specify
the name of the program on the fisk image by appending a colon
 (`:')
the name itself to the argument; for example
x64 "lovelygame.x64.gz:run me"

 will run the program named `run me' on `lovelygame.x64.gz'
instead of the first one.
 
 Using the command-line option
`-autostart' is equivalent; so the same
 result can be obtained with

x64 -autostart "lovelygame.x64.gz:run me"

 If you specify a raw CBM or P00 file, the emulator will setup the
file
 system based drive emulation so that it is enabled and accesses
the
 directory containing the file first.  This is a very convenient
way to
 start multi-file programs stored in file system directories
and not
 requiring "true" drive emulation.
 
 *Note Disk and tape
images::. for more information about images and
 autostart.
 

4 System files
**************


 In order to work properly, the emulators need to load a few system
files:


* the "system ROMs", raw binary files containing copies of the
original ROMs
 of the machine you are emulating;

* the "keyboard maps", text files describing the keyboard layout;


* the "palette files", text files describing the colors of the
machine you
 are emulating.

* the "romset files", text files describing the different ROMs to
load.

 The place where they will be searched for depends on the value of
the
 `Directory' resource, which is a colon (`:')-separated search
path list, like the UNIX `PATH' environment variable.  The
 default
value is
PREFIX/lib/vice/EMU:$HOME/.vice/EMU:BOOTPATH/EMU

 Where `PREFIX' is the installation prefix (usually
`/usr/local'), `EMU' is the name of the emulated machine
 (`C64',
`C128', `PET', `CBM-II' or `VIC20') and
 `BOOTPATH' is the directory
where the executable resides.
 The disk drive ROMs are looked for in a
directory with `EMU' set to 
 `DRIVES'. `$HOME' is the user's home
directory.
 
 For example, if you have the C64 emulator installed in

/usr/local/bin/x64

 then the value will be
/usr/local/lib/vice/C64:$HOME/.vice/C64:/usr/local/bin/C64

 And system files will be searched for under the following
directories,
 in the specified order:
1. `/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64'

2. `$HOME/.vice/C64'

3. `/usr/local/bin/C64'

 System files can still be installed in a different directory
if you
 specify a complete path instead of just a file name.  For
example, if
 you specify `./kernal' as the kernal image name, the
kernal image
 will be loaded from the current directory.  This can be
done by using
 command-line options or by modifying resource values
(*note Resource files::).
 

4.1 ROM files
=============


 Every emulator requires its own ROM set.  For the VIC20 and the C64,
the
 ROM set consists of the following files:


* `kernal',  the Kernal ROM (8 KBytes)

* `basic', the Basic ROM (8 KBytes)

* `chargen', the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

 The C128 needs the following files:


* `kernal', the Kernal ROM (8 Kbytes)

* `basic', the Basic + Editor ROM (32 Kbytes)

* `chargen', the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

 The C128, VIC20 and C64 emulators also need the following DOS
ROMs for
 the hardware-level emulation of the 1541, 1571 and 1581 disk
drives:


* `dos1541', the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

* `dos1541II', the 1541-II drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

* `dos1571', the 1571 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

* `dos1581', the 1581 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

 In addition to those all emulators can handle 
 a parallel
IEEE488 interface (the C64 and C128 via `$df**' extension,
 the VIC20
via VIC1112 emulation)
 so they also need the DOS ROM for the IEEE
disk drives:


* `dos2031', the 2031 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)
 (DOS 2.6, Commodore
ROM images 901484-03 and 901484-05)

* `dos2040', the 2040 drive ROM (8 Kbytes)
 (DOS 1, Commodore ROM
images 901468-06, 901468-07)

* `dos3040', the 3040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes)
 (DOS 2, Commodore ROM
images 901468-11, 901468-12 and 901468-13)

* `dos4040', the 4040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes)
 (DOS 2, Commodore ROM
images 901468-14, 901468-15 and 901468-16)

* `dos1001', the 1001/8050/8250 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)
 (DOS 2.7,
Commodore ROM images 901887-01 and 901888-01)

 Note that there are other DOS images on the internet. The DOS 2.5
images
 might be used with the 8050, but it cannot handle the double
sided drives
 of the 1001 and 8250 and it is not supported by VICE.

 The PET emulator uses an expanded setup, because there are three
major 
 versions of the Basic and the Kernal, and many versions of the

 Editor ROM. In addition there are cartridge ROM sockets.
 
 The
Kernal files contain the memory from range $F000-$FFFF, the Basic
ROMs either the range $C000-$DFFF or $B000-$DFFF.
 To handle the
different screen
 sizes and keyboards, different so-called
"editor-ROMs" for the memory
 range $E000-$E800 are provided. 
 The
PET ROMs have the following names:


* `kernal1', the PET2001 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes)
 (Commodore ROM
images 901447-06 and 901447-07)

* `kernal2', the PET3032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes)
 (Commodore ROM
image 901465-03)

* `kernal4', the PET4032/8032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes)
 (Commodore ROM
image 901465-22)

* `basic1', the PET2001 Basic 1 ROM (8 KBytes)
 (Commodore ROM
images 901447-09, 901447-02, 901447-03, 901447-04.bin.
 The -09
ROM is the revised -01 ROM)

* `basic2', the PET3032 Basic 2 ROM (8 KBytes)
 (Commodore ROM
images 901465-01 and 901465-01)

* `basic4', the PET4032/8032 Basic 4 ROM (12 KBytes)
 (Commodore
ROM images 901465-23, 901465-20 and 901465-21. 
 The -23 ROM is a
revised -19 ROM)

* `edit1g', the PET2001 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901447-05)

* `edit2b', the PET3032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-01)

* `edit2g', the PET3032 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901447-24)

* `edit4g40', the PET4032 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901498-01)

* `edit4b40', the PET4032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-02)

* `edit4b80', the PET8032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-04-?)

*

* `chargen', the character generator ROM (2k).  It has two sets
with 128 chars each.  The second (inverted) half of each set is
computed from
 the first half by inverting it.  This is a PET
hardware feature.
 (Commodore ROM image 901447-10)

* `chargen.de', the character generator ROM (2k). This version is a

 patched German charset, with the characters [,  and ] replaced
by umlauts.
 It has been provided by U. Guettich and he reports
that it is supported
 by some programs.

 The PETs also have sockets for extension ROMs for the addresses
$9000-$9FFF, $A000-$AFFF and $B000-$BFFF (the last one for PET2001 and
PET3032 only).  You can specify ROM image files for those extensions
command line options `-petrom9', `-petromA' and
 `-petromB' resp.
An alternative would be to specify a long kernal ROM with the
`-kernal' option that includes the extension ROM areas.
 
 Also, you
can specify replacements for the basic ROM at $B000-$DFFF
 with the
`-petromBasic' option and for the editor ROM
 at $E000-$E7FF with the
`-petromEditor' option.
 
 The CBM-II emulator again uses another
setup.  For those models the
 kernal used is the same for all.
However, for different amounts of
 memory exist different versions of
the BASIC ROMs.  The 128k RAM version
 (C610, C710, B128) uses one
bank of 64k for the BASIC text and another
 one for all the variables.
The 256k RAM version uses one bank for text,
 one for variables, one
for arrays and one for strings.
 
 Also the character generator ROMs
have a format different from the
 above.  The other character ROMs
have 8 bytes of pixel data per
 character.  Those ROMs have 16 bytes
per character instead.  The C6x0
 only uses the first 8 of it, but the
C7x0 uses 14 lines per character
 and needs those increased ROMs.
Both ROMs hold, like the PET, two
 character sets with 128 characters
each.  Again the second half of the
 full (256 char) character set is
computed by inverting.


* `kernal', the KERNAL (8k) for the business machines (6xx/7xx)

* `kernal.500', the KERNAL (8k) for the personal machine (510)
(901234-02)

* `basic.128', the CBM-II 128k BASIC (16k)

* `basic.256', CBM-II 256k BASIC (16k)

* `basic.500', C510 BASIC (16k) (901236-02 + 901235-02)

* `chargen.500', character generator ROM for the C5x0 (4k)
(901225-01)

* `chargen.600', character generator ROM for the C6x0 (4k)

* `chargen.700', character generator ROM for the C7x0 (4k)


4.2 Keymap files
================


 "Keymap files" are used to define the keyboard layout, defining
which
 key (or combination of keys) must be mapped to each keysym.
In other words, the keyboard emulation works like this: whenever the
user presses or releases a key while the emulation window has the
input
 focus, the emulator receives an X-Window event with a value
that
 identifies that key.  That value is called a "keysym" and is
unique
 to that key.  The emulator then looks up that keysym in an
internal
 table that tells it which key(s) to press or release on the
emulated
 keyboard.
 
 This table is described by the keymap file,
which is made up of lines
 like the following:
KEYSYM ROW COLUMN SHIFTFLAG

 Where:


* `KEYSYM' is a string identifying the keysym: you can use the
`xev' utility (shipped with the X Window system) to see what
keysym
 is bound to any key;

* `ROW' and `COLUMN' identify the key on the emulated keyboard;

* `SHIFTFLAG' can have one of the following values:


* `0': the key is never shifted;

* `1': the key is shifted;

* `2': the key is the left shift;

* `4': the key is the right shift;

* `8': the key can be (optionally) shifted by the user.


 The `SHIFTFLAG' is useful if you want certain keys to be
"artificially" shifted by the emulator, and not by the user.  For
example, <F2> is shifted on the C64 keyboard, but you might want it
to be mapped to the unshifted <F2> key on the PC keyboard.  To do
 so,
you just have to use a line like the following:
F2 0 4 1

 where `0' and `4' identify the key (row 0, column 4 on the
keyboard matrix), and `1' specifies that every time the user presses
<F2> the shift key on the C64 keyboard must be pressed.
 
 There are
also some special commands you can put into the keyboard file;
 they
are recognized because they start with an exclamation mark:


* `!CLEAR' clears the currently loaded keyboard map; it is
necessary to put this at the beginning of the file if you want
the
 keymap file to override all of the current internal
settings;

* `!LSHIFT', `!RSHIFT', followed by a row and a column
 value,
specify where the left and right shift keys are located on the
emulated keyboard; for example, C64 default keymaps will specify

!LSHIFT 1 7
!RSHIFT 6 4


 Any line starting with the `#' sign, instead, is completely
ignored.  This is useful for adding comments within the keymap file.

 VICE keymap files have the `.vkm' default extension, and every
emulator comes with a default positional mapping and a default
symbolic
 mapping.
 

4.3 Palette files
=================


 "Palette files" are used to specify the colors used in the
emulators.  They are made up of lines like the following:
RED GREEN BLUE DITHER

 where `RED', `GREEN' and `BLUE' are hexadecimal values
 ranging
from 0 to FF and specifying the amount of red, green and blue
 you
want for each color and `DITHER' is a 4-bit hexadecimal number
specifying the pattern you want when rendering on a B/W display.
You have to include as many lines as the number of colors the emulated
machine has, and the order of the lines must respect the one used in
the
 machine (so the N'th line must contain the specifications for
color N -
 1 in the emulated machine).
 
 Lines starting with the
`#' sign are completely ignored.  This is
 useful for adding comments
(such as color names) within the palette
 file.
 
 For example, the
default PET palette file (which has only two colors, 0 for
 background
and 1 for foreground), looks like the following:
#
# VICE Palette file
#
# Syntax:
# Red Green Blue Dither
#

# Background
00 00 00 0

# Foreground
00 FF 00 F


4.4 Romset files
================


 The Romset files are not used by default on all emulators. 
 You
might have recognized that the names of the ROM images are 
 saved in
resources. Loading a Romset file now just means a `shortcut'
 to
changing all the resources with ROM image names and reloading
 the
ROMs. 
 
 The PET and CBM-II emulators use this feature to change
between the
 different ROM versions available for those machines. E.g.
the 
 Romset file for the PET 2001 is
KernalName="pet2001"
EditorName=
ChargenName="chargen"
RomModule9Name=
RomModuleAName=
RomModuleBName=

 As you can see, the file even uses the same syntax as the
resource file, it is just a bit stripped down.

5 Basic operation
*****************


 This section describes the basic things you can do once the
emulator
 has been fired up.
 
 

5.1 The emulation window
========================


 When the emulator is run, the screen of the emulated machine is
displayed in a standard X Window which we will call the "emulation
window".  This window will be updated in real time, displaying the
same
 contents that a real monitor or TV set would.
 
 Below the
emulation window there is an area which is used to display
information about the state of the emulator; we will call this area
the
 "status bar".
 
 On the extreme left of the status bar, there
is a "performance
 meter".  This displays the current relative speed
of the emulator (as a
 percentage) and the update frequency (in frames
per second).  All the
 machines emulated are PAL, so the update
frequency will be 50 frames
 per second if your system is fast enough
to allow emulation at
 the speed of the real machine.
 
 On the
extreme right of the status bar, there is a "drive status
 indicator".
This is only visible if the hardware-level ("True") 1541
 emulation is
turned on.  In that case, the drive status indicator will
 contain a
rectangle emulating the drive LED and will display the current
 track
position of the drive's read/write head.

5.2 Using the menus
===================


 It is possible to execute some commands and change emulation
parameters
 while the emulator is running: when the pointer is over
the emulation
 window, two menus are available by pressing either the
left or right
 mouse buttons.  The left mouse button will open the
"command menu"
 from which several emulation-related commands can be
executed; the right
 mouse button will open the "settings menu" from
which emulation
 parameters can be changed.  The basic difference
between the command and
 the settings menu is that, while commands
have only effect on the
 current session, settings can be saved and
later used with the "Save
 settings" and "Load settings" right-button
menu items, respectively.
 "Restore default settings" restores the
factory defaults.
 *Note Settings and resources::. for more
information about how settings
 work in VICE.
 
 Sometimes commands
can be reached via "shortcuts" or "hotkeys",
 i.e., it is possible to
execute them by pressing a sequence of keys
 instead of going through
the menu with the mouse.  Where shortcuts
 exist, they are displayed
in parentheses at the right edge of the menu
 item.  In VICE, all
shortcuts must begin with the <Meta> or
 <Alt> key.  So, for example,
to attach a disk image to drive #8 (the
 corresponding menu item
displays "M-8"), you have to press the
 <Meta> (or <Alt>) and then
<8>.
 
 Note that no other key presses are passed on to the emulated
machine
 while either <Meta> or <Alt> are held down.
 

5.3 Getting help
================


 At any time, if you get stuck or do not remember how to perform a
certain action, you can use the "Browse manuals" command (left button
menu).  This will popup a browser and open the HTML version of this
documentation.  Notice that this requires VICE to be properly (and
fully) installed with a `make install'.
 
 The browser can be
specified via the `HTMLBrowserCommand' string
 resource (*note
Settings and resources:: for information about
 resources).  Every
`%s' in the string will be replaced with a URL
 to the VICE HTML
pages.
 

5.4 Using the file selector
===========================


 In those situations where it is necessary to specify a file name,
all
 of the VICE emulators will pop up a file selector window
allowing
 you to select or specify a file interactively.
 
 To the
left of the file selector, there is a list of ancestor
 directories:
by clicking on them, you can ascend the directory tree.  To
 the
right, there is a list of the files in the current directory; files
can be selected by clicking on them.  If you click on a directory,
that
 directory becomes the current one; if you click on an ordinary
file, it
 becomes the active selection.
 
 At the top, there is a
"directory box", with the complete path of
 the current directory, and
a "file name box", with the name of the
 currently selected file.  At
the bottom there are two buttons: "OK"
 confirms the selected file and
"Cancel" abandons the file selector
 without cancelling the
operation.
 
 It is also possible to specify what files you want to
show in the file
 selector by writing an appropriate shell-like
pattern in the directory
 box; e.g., `~/*.[dx]64' will only show files
in the home directory whose
 name ends with either `.d64' or with
`.x64'.
 

5.5 Using disk and tape images
==============================


 The emulator is able to emulate disk drives and (read-only) tape
recorders if provided with suitable "disk images" or "tape
 images".
An "image" is a raw dump of the contents of the media, and
 must be
"attached" before the emulator can use it.  "Attaching" a
 disk or
tape image is like "virtually" inserting a diskette or a
 cassette
into the disk drive or the tape recorder: once an image is
 attached,
the emulator is able to use it as a storage media.
 
 There are five
commands (in the left button menu) that deal with disk
 and tape
images:


* Attach Disk Image

* Detach Disk Image

* Attach Tape Image

* Detach Tape Image

* Smart-attach a file

 The first four commands are used to insert and remove the virtual
disks
 and cassettes from the respective units.  On the other hand,
the
 last commands tries to guess the type of the image you are
attaching
 from its name and size, and attaches it to the most
reasonable device.
 
 Supported formats are `D64' and `X64' for disk
images (devices
 8, 9 and 10) and `T64' for tape images.  Notice that
`T64'
 support is _read-only_, and that the cassette is automatically
rewound when you reach its end.
 
 Another important feature is that
raw Commodore BASIC binary files and
 .P00 files can be attached as
tapes.  As you can autostart a
 tape image when it is attached (*note
Autostart::), this allows you to
 autostart these particular files as
well.
 
 You can attach a disk for which you do not have write
permissions: when this
 happens, the 1541 emulator will emulate a
write-protected disk.  This is
 also useful if you want to prevent
certain disk images from being
 written to; in the latter case, just
remove the write permission for
 that file, e.g., by doing a `chmod
a-w'.
 

5.5.1 Previewing the image contents
-----------------------------------


 It is possible to examine the directory of a disk or tape image
before
 attaching it.  Just press the "Contents" button in the file
selector
 window and a new window will pop up with the contents of the
selected
 image.
 
 Notice that this function automatically
translates the directory from
 PETSCII to ASCII; but, due to
differences in the two encodings, it is
 not always possible to
translate all the characters, so you might get
 funny results when
"weird" characters such as the semi-graphical ones
 are being used.


5.5.2 "Autostarting" an image
-----------------------------


 If you want to reset the machine and run the first program on a
certain
 image without typing any commands at the Commodore BASIC
prompt, you can
 use the "Autostart" button in the file selector
window after selecting
 a proper disk or tape image file.
 
 Notice
that, if true drive emulation is turned on, it will be turned off
before running the program and then turned on again after it has been
loaded.  This way, you get the maximum possible speed while loading
the
 file, but you do not lose compatibility once the program itself
is
 running.
 
 This method is not completely safe, because some
autostarting methods
 might cause the true drive emulation not to be
turned on again.  In such
 cases, the best thing to do is to disable
kernal traps (which will cause
 true drive emulation to be always kept
turned on), or to manually load
 the program with true drive emulation
turned on.
 

5.5.3 Using compressed files
----------------------------


 It is also possible to attach disk or tape images that have been
compressed through various algorithms; compression formats are
identified from the file extension.  The following formats are
supported
 (the expected file name extension is in parenthesis):
* GNU Zip (`.gz' or `.z');

* BZip version 2 (`.bz2');

* PkZip (`.zip');

* GNU Zipped TAR archives (`.tar.gz', `.tgz');

* Zoo (`.zoo').

 PkZip, `tar.gz', `lha' and `zoo' support is
 _read-only_ and
always uses the _first_ `T64' or
 `D64' file in the archive.  So
archives containing multiple files
 will always be handled as if they
contain only a single file.
 
 Windows and MSDOS don't contain the
needful programs to handle
 compressed archives. Get gzip and unzip
for Windows at
 ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/WIN32 and for
MSDOS at
 ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/MSDOS. Don't use
pkunzip
 for MSDOS, it doesn't work. The programs to use BZip2
archives may be
 found at http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2.
 Just
put the programs (unzip.exe, gzip.exe, bzip2.exe) into a directory
 of
your search path (e.g. C:DOS or C:WINDOWSCOMMAND; have a look at
the PATH variable).

5.5.4 Using Zipcode and Lynx images
-----------------------------------


 Since version 0.15, the VICE emulators have been able to attach
disks
 packed with Zipcode or Lynx directly, removing the need to
manually
 convert them into `D64' or `X64' files with `c1541'.
 This
is achieved by automatically invoking `c1541', letting it
 decode the
file into a temporary image and attaching the resulting
 temporary
image read-only.  For this to work, the directory containing
 `c1541'
must be in your `PATH'.
 
 This uses the `-unlynx' and `-zcreate'
options of `c1541'
 (*note c1541 commands and options::); these
commands are not very
 reliable yet, and could fail with certain kinds
of Lynx and Zipcode
 images (for example, they cannot deal with `DEL'
files properly).
 So please use them with caution.
 
 Lynx files
usually come as `.lnx' files which are unpacked into
 single disk
images.  On the other hand, Zipcode files do not have a
 particular
extension (although `.z64' is sometimes used), and
 represent a disk
by means of component files, named as follows:
* `1!NAME'

* `2!NAME'

* `3!NAME'

* `4!NAME'

 If you attach as a disk image (or smart-attach) any one of these
files,
 the emulator will simply pick up the other three (by
examining
 the name) and then build a disk image using all four.


5.6 Resetting the machine
=========================


 You can reset the emulated machine at any time by using the "Reset"
command from the command menu.  There are two types of reset:
* "soft reset", which simply resets the CPU and all the other
chips;

* "hard reset", which also clears up the contents of RAM.

 A "soft reset" is the same as a hardware reset achieved by
pulling
 the RESET line down; a "hard reset" is more like a power
on/power off sequence in that it makes sure the whole RAM is cleared.

 It is possible that a soft reset may not be enough to take the
machine
 to the OS initialization sequence: in such cases, you will
have to do a
 hard reset instead.
 
 This is especially the case for
the CBM-II emulators.  Those machines
 examine a memory location and
if they find a certain "magic" value they
 only do what you know from
the C64 as `Run/Stop-Restore'.
 Therefore, to really reset a CBM-II
use hard reset.

6 Settings and resources
************************


 In the VICE emulators, all the settings are stored in entities known
as
 called "resources".  Each resource has a name and a value which
may
 be either an integer or a string.  Integer values are often used
as
 boolean values with the usual convention of using zero for
"false"
 and any other value for "true".
 
 Resource values can be
changed via the right-button menu (the
 "settings" menu), via
command-line options or via the "resource
 file".
 
 The "resource
file" is a human-readable file containing resource
 values: it is
called `vicerc' and is stored in the directory 
 `.vice/' in the
user's home
 directory.  It is possible to dump the current values of
the resources
 into that file or load the values stored into that file
as the current
 values, at any time.  This is achieved with the "Save
settings" and
 "Load settings" right menu items.  A third menu item,
"Restore
 Default Settings", can be used to reset all the values to
the factory
 defaults.
 
 A special resource, `SaveResourcesOnExit',
if set to a non zero
 value, causes the emulator to ask you if you
want to save the current
 (changed) settings before exiting, and can
be toggled with the "Save
 settings on exit" command from the
right-button menu.
 
 Notice that not all the resources can be
changed from the menus; some of
 them can only be changed by manually
modifying the resource file or by
 using command-line options.
 

6.1 Format of resource files
============================


 A resource file is made up of several sections; sections have the
purpose of separating the resources of a certain emulator from the
ones
 of the other emulators.  A section starts with the name of an
emulator in brackets (e.g., `[C64]') and ends when another section
starts or when the file ends.
 
 Every line in a section has the
following format:
RESOURCE=VALUE

 where `RESOURCE' is the name of a resource and `VALUE' is its
assigned value.  Resource names are case-sensitive and resource values
are either strings or integers.  Strings must start and end with a
double quote character (`"'), while integers must be given in
 decimal
notation.
 
 Here is an example of a stripped-down `.vice/vicerc'
file:
[VIC20]
HTMLBrowserCommand="netscape %s"
SaveResourcesOnExit=0
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/vic20p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1
[C64]
HTMLBrowserCommand="netscape %s"
SaveResourcesOnExit=1
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/c64p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1

 Notice that, when resource values are saved with "Save settings",
the
 emulator only modifies its own section, leaving the others
unchanged.

6.2 Using command-line options to change resources
==================================================


 Resources can also be changed via command-line options.
Command-line options always override the defaults from `.vice/vicerc',
and their assignments last for the whole session.  So, if you specify
a
 certain command-line option that changes a certain resource from
its
 default value and then use "Save Settings", the value specified
with
 the command-line option will be saved back to the resource
file.
 
 Command-line options can begin with with a minus sign (`-')
or
 with a plus sign (`+').  Options beginning with a minus sign
 may
require an additional parameter, while the ones beginning with the
plus sign never require one.
 
 Moreover, options beginning with a
plus sign always have a counterpart
 with the same name, but with a
minus sign; in that case, the option
 beginning with a minus sign is
used to _enable_ a certain
 feature, while the one beginning with a
plus sign is used to
 _disable_ the same feature (this is an X11
convention).  For
 example, `-mitshm' enables support of MITSHM, while
`+mitshm'
 disables it.
 

6.3 Performance settings
========================


 It is possible to control the emulation speed by using the "Maximum
speed" menu item in the right-button menu.  The default setting is
`100', which causes the emulation to never run faster than the real
machine.  A higher value allows the emulator to run faster, a lower
one
 may force it to run slower.  The setting "No limit" means to run
as
 fast as possible, without limiting speed.
 
 It is also possible
to control the emulator's rate of frame update using
 the "Refresh
rate" setting; the value ranges from "1/1" (update 1/1
 of the frames
of the real machine, that is 50 frames per second) to
 "1/10" (update
1 every 10 frames) and can be changed via the "Refresh
 Rate" submenu.
The "Auto" setting means to dynamically adapt the
 refresh rate to the
current speed of the host machine, making sure the
 maximum speed
specified by the via "Maxium speed" is always reached if
 possible.
In any case, the refresh rate will never be worse than 1/10
 if this
option is specified.
 
 Note that you cannot simultaneously specify
"Auto" as the refresh rate
 and "No limit" as the maximum speed..
 
 Moreover,
a special "warp speed" mode is provided and can be toggled
 with the
"Enable Warp Mode" menu item.  If this mode is enabled, it
 will cause
the emulator to disable any speed limit, turn sound emulation
 off and
use a 1/10 refresh rate, so that it will run at the maximum
 possible
speed.
 

6.3.1 Performance resources
---------------------------




`Speed'
Integer specifying the maximum relative speed, as a percentage.
`0'
 stands for "no limit".
 

`RefreshRate'
Integer specifying the refresh rate; a value of `n' specifies a
refresh rate of 1/`n'.  A value of `0' enables automatic frame
skipping.
 

`WarpMode'
Booolean specifying whether "warp mode" is turned on or not.


6.3.2 Performance command-line options
--------------------------------------




`-speed VALUE'
Specifies the maximum speed as a percentage.  `0' stands for "no
limit".  (Same as setting the `Speed' resource.)
 

`-refresh VALUE'
Specifies refresh rate; a value of `n' specifies a refresh rate
of
 1/`n'.  A value of `0' enables automatic frame skipping.
(Same as setting the `RefreshRate' resource.)
 

`-warp'
`+warp'
Enables/disables warp mode (`WarpMode=1', `WarpMode=0').


6.4 Video settings
==================


 The following right-button menu items control the video output.
 On
emulators that include two video chips (like `x128')
 all options but
XSync exist twice, once for each chip.
 XSync is shared between the
video chips.


* "Video Cache" enables a video cache that can speed up the
emulation
 when little graphics activity is going on; it is
especially useful when
 you run the emulator on a networked X
terminal as it can reduce the
 network bandwidth required.
However, this setting can actually make the
 emulator slower when
there is little graphics activity and the amount of
 work needed
to maintain the cache is greater than the amount of work that
would be wasted by not using it (if any).
 

* "Double Size" toggles "double-size mode", which makes the
emulation window twice as big.  When emulating a 80-column PET,
only the
 height is doubled, so that the aspect ratio is closer
to that of the
 real thing.
 

* "Double Scan" toggles "double-scan mode", which causes the
emulator to draw only odd lines when running in double-size mode
(this
 saves some CPU time and also makes the emulation window
look more like
 an old monitor).
 

* `Use XSync()" causes the emulator to call the X11 function
`XSync()' before updating the emulation window: this might be
necessary on low-end systems to prevent it from consuming so many
system
 resources that it becomes impossible for the user to
interact with it.

 

6.4.1 Video resources
---------------------


 The following resources affect the screen emulation. The prefix of
some of the resources and commandline options denote the video chip
the values apply to.


`UseXSync'
Boolean specifying whether `XSync()' is called after updating the
emulation window.
 

`MITSHM'
Integer specifying whether VICE should try to use the shared
memory
 extensions (MITSHM) when starting up.  The shared memory
extensions make
 things a lot faster but might not be available
on your system.  You will
 not be able to use these extensions if
you are sitting at an X terminal
 while running the emulator on a
remote machine across a network.  Valid
 values are: 0 = do not
use MITSHM, 1 = do use MITSHM, -1 = try to
 autodetect
availability on startup (default).  The last is a simple test
 if
the emulator runs across a network and if so disables MITSHM (If
you
 have problems with this test please report it).
 

`PrivateColormap'
Boolean specifying whether VICE should install a private colormap
at
 startup.  This makes sense for 8-bit displays that could run
out of
 colors if other color-hungry applications are running at
the same time.
 

`DisplayDepth'
Integer specifying the depth of the host display.  The value `0'
(the default) causes the emulator to autodetect it.


6.4.2 Video command-line options
--------------------------------




`-xsync'
`+xsync'
Enable/disable usage of `XSync()' when updating the emulation
window (`UseXSync=1', `UseXSync=0').
 

`-mitshm'
`+mitshm'
Enable/disable usage of the MITSHM extensions (`MITSHM=1',
`MITSHM=0').
 

`-install'
`+install'
Enable/disable installation of a private colormap
(`PrivateColormap=1', `PrivateColormap=0').
 

`-displaydepth DEPTH'
Specify the display depth (`DisplayDepth').
 

`-fullscreen'
`+fullscreen'
Enable/disable fullscreen mode


6.5 Keyboard settings
=====================


 It is possible to specify whether the "positional" or "symbolic"
keyboard mapping should be used with the "Keyboard mapping type"
submenu (*note Keyboard emulation:: for an explanation of positional
and symbolic mappings).
 
 The keyboard settings submenu also allows
you to:
* Load custom-made positional and symbolic keymap files
 ("Set
symbolic keymap file" and "Set positional keymap file").

* Dump the current keymap to a user-defined keymap file ("Dump to
keymap
 file").

 

6.5.1 Keyboard resources
------------------------




`KeymapIndex'
Integer identifying which keymap is being used; `0' indicates
symbolic mapping, `1' positional mapping.  For the PET the even
values represent symbolic mapping, odd positional.  Then add `0'
for UK business keyboard or `2' for graphics keyboard.
 

`KeymapSymFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic
mapping
 (*note Keyboard emulation::, all but PET and CBM-II).


`KeymapPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the positional
mapping
 (*note Keyboard emulation::, all but PET and CBM-II).


`KeymapBusinessUKSymFile'
`KeymapBusinessUKPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic
and positional mapping for the UK business keyboard
 (*note
Keyboard emulation::, PET and CBM-II).
 

`KeymapGraphicsSymFile'
`KeymapGraphicsPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic and

 positional mapping for the graphics keyboard
 (*note Keyboard
emulation::, PET only).
 

`KeymapBusinessDESymFile'
`KeymapBusinessDEPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic
and positional mapping for the German business keyboard.
 (*note
Keyboard emulation::, PET only).


6.5.2 Keyboard command-line options
-----------------------------------




`-keymap N'
Specifies which keymap is being used; `0' indicates symbolic
mapping, `1' positional mapping (as for the `KeymapIndex'
resource).
 

`-symkeymap NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the symbolic keymap file (`KeymapSymFile').
 

`-poskeymap NAME'

6.7 Sound settings
==================


 The following menu items control sound output:


* "Enable sound playback" turns sound emulation on and off.
 

* "Sound synchronization" specifies the method for syncronizing the
sound playback.  Possible settings are:
* "Flexible", i.e., the audio renderer flexibly adds/removes
samples to
 the output to smoothly adapt the playback to
slight changes in the speed
 of the emulator.

* "Adjusting" works like "flexible", but supports bigger
differences
 in speed.  For example, if the emulation speed
drops down from from 100%
 to 50%, audio slows down by the
same amount too.

* "Exact", instead, makes the audio renderer output always the
same
 sounds you would hear from the real thing, without
trying to adapt the
 ratio; to compensate the tolerances in
speed, some extra frames will be
 skipped or added.


* "Sample rate" specifies the sampling frequency, ranging from 8000
to
 48000 Hz (not all the sound cards and/or sound drivers can
support all
 the frequencies, so actually the nearest candidate
will be chosen).
 

* "Buffer size" specifies the size of the audio buffer; the bigger
the
 buffer, the longer the delay with which sounds are played.
You should
 pick the smallest value your machine can handle
without problems.
 

* "Sound suspend time", will cause the audio playback to pause for
the
 specified number of seconds whenever some clicking happens.
If "Keep
 going" is selected, no pausing is done.
 

* "Oversample" specifies an oversampling factor, from 1 to 8 times
(warning: this eats CPU cycles!).

`-dsspeedtuning <value>'

6.9 Drive settings
==================


 These settings are used to control the hardware-level emulation of
the Disk
 drives.  When hardware-level emulation is turned on, only
drives 8 and 9
 are being emulated.
 
 The following settings affect
both drives:


* "Enable true drive emulation" enables the (slow) hardware-level
emulation of the drives for maximum compatibility.  This must be
turned
 on for any of the following settings to have effect.

* "Drive sync factor" specifies the speed of the drive's CPU.  This
can
 be used to help loading certain programs that have trouble
with the
 default PAL setting (for example, programs designed for
NTSC machines).
 The ratio is calculated as follows:
sync_factor = 65536 * clk_drive / clk_machine

 where `clk_drive' and `clk_machine' are clock speeds in MHz.
The menu lets you choose between the PAL and NTSC values, and also
lets
 you specify whatever value you want.  Be careful when
changing it,
 though, because a wrong value can break things and
even corrupt disk
 images.

 The following settings, instead, are specific of each drive:


* "Drive model" specifies the model of the drive being emulated.
*Warning:* This will reset the drive.

* "Enable parallel cable" enables emulation of a SpeedDOS parallel
cable; if you switch this option on and replace the original
Commodore
 ROMs with SpeedDOS-compatible ones, you can speed up
loading/saving times.

* "Idle method" specifies which method the drive emulation should
use to
 save CPU cycles in the host CPU.  There are three
methods:
* "Skip cycles": Each time the serial line is accessed by the
C64, the
 drive executes all the cycles since the last time
it ran.  If
 the number of elapsed cycles is larger than a
certain value, the drive
 discards part of them.

* "Trap idle": The disk drive is still emulated upon serial
line
 accesses as with the previous option, but it is also
always emulated at
 the end of each screen frame.  If the
drive gets into the DOS idle loop,
 only pending interrupts
are emulated to save time.

* "No traps": Like "Trap idle", but without any traps at all.
So
 basically the drive works exactly as with the real
thing, and nothing is
 done to reduce the power needs of the
drive emulation.

 The first option ("Skip cycles") is usually best for
performance, as
 the drive is emulated as little as possible; on
the other hand, you may
 notice sudden slowdowns (when the drive
executes several cycles at once)
 and the LED status is never
updated (because it would not be possible to
 do correctly so).
Moreover, if the drive tries to get in sync with the
 computer in
some weird way and the computer does not access the serial
 line
for a long time, it is possible that some cycles are discarded
and
 the sync is lost.  Notice that this hack will have no effect
on
 performance if a program continuously reads from the IEC
port, as the
 drive will have to be fully emulated in any case
(some stupid programs
 do this, even when they don't actually
need to use the drive).
 
 
 The second option ("Trap idle") is
usually a bit slower, as at least
 interrupts are always
emulated, but ensures the LED state is always
 updated correctly
and always keeps the drive and the computer in sync.
 On the
other hand, if a program installs a non-standard idle loop in the
drive, the drive CPU has to be emulated even when not necessary
and the
 global emulation speed is then _much_ slower.

* "40-track image support" specifies how 40-track ("extended") disk
images should be supported.  There are three possible ways:
* "Never extend" never extends disk images at all (so if a
program tries
 to write tracks beyond the 35th, it is not
allowed to do so);

* "Ask on extend" prompts the user as soon as a program tries
to write
 tracks beyond the 35th, and the user can then
choose whether he wants
 the disk image to be extended or
not;

* "Extend on access" simply extends the disk image as soon the
program
 needs it, without prompting the user.

6.10 Peripheral settings
========================


 VICE is able to support some special peripherals:
* "file system devices", pseudo-drives accessing the Unix file
system;

* printers.

 These features depend on some "kernal traps" that replace the
existing routines in the original Commodore operating system with
custom-made C routines.
 

6.10.1 Settings for file system devices
---------------------------------------


 These settings deal with the drive-like peripherals connected to the
bus
 of the emulated machine. 
 The first setting relates to the
parallel IEEE488 interface. With 
 this interface a special engine is
used to listen to the bus lines 
 to translates them to the filesystem
code. Thus the PET will always
 detect a drive for example, but it can
also use drives 10 and 11 even
 together with true disk drive
emulation. 
* "Enable virtual devices", enables the peripheral access via
 the
fast disk emulation (either kernal traps or IEEE488 interface).
Both, filesystem and disk image access via fast
 drive emulation,
are affected.

 Four peripherals, numbered from 8 to 11, are
 accessible; each
of them provides the following settings:
* "File system access", if enabled, allows the device to emulate a
drive
 accessing a file system directory; note that when a disk
image is
 attached to the same drive, the directory is no longer
visible and the
 attached disk is used instead.

* "File system directory" specifies the directory to be accessed by
the
 drive.

* "Convert P00 file names", if enabled, allows access to P00 files
using
 their built-in name instead of the Unix one.

* "Create P00 files on save", if enabled, creates P00 files (instead
of
 raw CBM files) whenever a program creates a file.

 Note that, by default, all drives except 11 create P00 files on
save,
 while drive 11 creates raw CBM files. Those files come without
any header, 
 but also with the filename restrictions given by the
operating system
 VICE runs on.

`FSDevice10Dir' and `FSDevice11Dir').
 

`-flipname <name>'
Specify name of the flip list file image


6.10.2 Printer settings
-----------------------


 The VICE emulators can emulate printers connected to either the IEC
buffer or the user port.  Emulation can be achieved by redirecting the
printer output to a file or by piping it through an external process.
This is defined by so-called "printer device file names"; a printer
device file name can be either a simple path, or a command name
preceeded by a pipe symbol `|'.
 
 For example, printer device
`filename' will cause the output to be
 appended to the file
`filename', while printer device `|lpr'
 will cause the `lpr' command
to be executed and be fed the printer
 output.  The printer output
will not be converted but saved as printed
 by the emulated machine.

 Up to three printer devices may be specified through the following
resources:
* device 1, whose default value is `print.dump';

* device 2, whose default value is `|lpr'.

* device 3, whose default value is `|petlp -F PS|lpr';

 So, basically, by default printer device 1 will dump printer
output to `print.dump'; printer device 2 will print it via
 `lpr'
directly to the printer and device 3 will print it via
 `petlp' (a
not-yet-complete utility that will produce Postscript
 output from the
Commodore printer code) and then to the printer via 
 `lpr'.

6.10.3 Disabling kernal traps
-----------------------------


 If you have compatibility problems, you can completely disable
Kernal
 traps with the "Disable kernal traps" option.  This will of
course
 disable all the features that depend on it, such as the fast
1541
 emulation (so you will have to turn true 1541 emulation on if
you want
 to be able to read or write disk images) and tape support.


6.10.3.1 Resources to control Kernal traps
..........................................




`VirtualDevices'
Boolean specifying whether all the mechanisms for virtual device
emulation should be enabled. Serial IEC devices use kernal traps,

 parallel IEEE488 devices use an own IEEE488 engine. Both are
switched
 on and off with this resource.

.....................................................




`-virtualdev'
`+virtualdev'
Enable (`VirtualDevices=1') or disable (`VirtualDevices=0')
virtual devices.


6.11 RS232 settings
===================


 The VICE emulators can emulate the RS232 device most of the
machines
 have.  The C64, C128 and VIC20 emulators emulate the
userport RS232
 interface at 300 and 1200 baud.  The C64 and C128 can
also use the 9600
 baud interface by Daniel Dallmann, using the shift
registers of the two
 CIA 6526 chips.  The PET can have a 6551 ACIA
RS232 interface when
 running as a SuperPET, and the CBM-II has such
an ACIA by default.  The
 C64 and C128 emulators can emulate an ACIA
6551 (also known as Datapump
 for example) as extension at `$de**'.

 Emulation can be achieved by either:
* connecting a real UNIX serial device;

* dumping to a file;

* piping through a process.

 It is possible to define up to four UNIX serial devices, and then
decide
 which interface should be connected to which device.  This is
done by
 so-called "rs232 device file names"; an rs232 device file
name can
 be either a simple path, or a command name preceeded by a
pipe symbol
 `|'.  If the path specifies a special device (e.g.
`/dev/ttyS0') it
 is recognized by VICE and the emulator can set the
baudrate.
 
 For example, rs232 device `filename' will cause the
output to be
 written (not appended) to the file `filename', while
printer device
 `|lpr' will cause the `lpr' command to be executed and
be fed
 the rs232 output.  The rs232 output will not be converted but
saved as
 sent by the emulated machine.  The same holds true for the
rs232 input.
 If the command writes data to the standard output it
will be caught by VICE 
 and sent back to the emulator.  Also the data
sent by the pseudo device will
 be sent back to VICE.
 
 For example
you can setup a null-modem cable between two serial ports
 of your PC,
setup one port for login and use the other in VICE.  Then you
 can
login from your emulator via the RS232 emulation and the null-modem
cable to your machine again.
 
 You can not simply run a shell from
VICE, as the shell will notice that
 it does not run on its own pseudo
terminal and will thus buffer its
 output.  You need to write some
program that opens an own pseudo terminal
 and runs the shell from
there (not yet finished).
 
 Up to four RS232 devices may be
specified through the following
 resources:
* device 1, whose default value is `/dev/ttyS0';

* device 2, whose default value is `/dev/ttyS1';

* device 3, whose default value is `rs232.dump';

* device 4, whose default value is `|lpr'.

 For the first two devices you can change the baudrate the tty
device is
 set to by specifying it on the commandline or in the menu.
This
 baudrate is 9600 by default for the latter two, but can be
changed only
 by resources (The baudrate is independent from the
baudrate the emulator
 actually expects).

6.11.3 RS232 usage example
--------------------------


 Here we give you a simple example how to set up an emulated C64
using
 the modem connected to your PC. The following list shows each
step.
`Attach your modem to your PC at a serial port.'
Normally you should set it up to use the modem as "/dev/modem".

`start VICE'


`Setup VICE to use your modem as "serial device 1"'
Go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 device" to
"/dev/modem" (or the device where you attached your modem to)
Then go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 baudrate"
to the baudrate your modem should run at.
   Watch out, e.g. on
Linux there is an additional multiplier
   to multiply with the
baudrate (so e.g. 19200 gives 115200 or so baud)
   See the
"setserial" manpage on Linux for example. 
   However, most
modems should be able to autodetect the speed to 
   the computer
as well.

`Select the RS232 emulation your programs use'
If you want to use the Userport emulation, go to the RS232
settings and 
   change "Userport RS232 Device" to 
   "Serial
1". If you want ACIA emulation (swiftlink or what's it called?)
then change "ACIA $DE** device" to "Serial 1".

`Enable the emulation'
Go to the RS232 settings and select either "ACIA $DE** emulation"
or Userport 300/1200 baud or CIA 9600 baud emulation.

`Load your program and start it.'
If it is able to detect an
   RS232 cartridge like swiftlink or
so, try to detect the ACIA emulation
   if enabled.
Otherwise just set the baudrate to either 300, 1200 or 9600
according
   to what you enabled in the VICE menu for the
userport.


6.12 Monitor settings
=====================


 This section lists command-line options specific to the built-in
monitor.
 

6.12.1 Monitor command-line options
-----------------------------------


`-moncommands FILENAME'
Execute the commands from the file `FILENAME' in the monitor after
starting up. This
 command line switch is mainly thought to load
labels and to set breakpoints.
 Not all other commands are useful
to be executed in this way, some may even
 lead to strange
effects.
 

`-initbreak <address>'
Set an initial breakpoint for the monitor. Addresses with prefix
"0x" are hexadecimal.
 

`-remotemonitor'
`+remotemonitor'
Enable/Disable remote monitor
 

`-remotemonitoraddress <name>'
The local address the remote monitor should bind to


6.13 Machine settings
=====================



6.13.1 Machine command-line options
-----------------------------------




`-pal'
Use PAL sync factor

`-ntsc'
Use NTSC sync factor

`-ntscold'
Use old NTSC sync factor

`-paln'
Use PAL-N sync factor


6.14 Memory settings
====================



6.14.1 Memory command-line options
----------------------------------




`-raminitstartvalue <value>'
Set the value for the very first RAM address after powerup

`-raminitvalueinvert <num of bytes>'
Length of memory block initialized with the same value

`-raminitpatterninvert <num of bytes>'
Length of memory block initialized with the same pattern


6.15 Miscellaneous settings
===========================


 This section lists generic resources that do not fit in the other
categories.
 

6.15.1 Miscellaneous resources
------------------------------


`Directory'
String specifying the search path for system files.  It is defined
as a
 sequence of directory names, separated by colons (`:'),
just like
 the `PATH' variable in the shell.  The special string
`$$'
 stands for the default search path, which is initialized at
startup to
 the following value:
LIBDIR/EMUID:$HOME/.vice/EMUID:BOOTPATH/EMUID:LIBDIR/DRIVES:$HOME/.vice/DRIVES:BOOTPATH/DRIVES

 where:
* `LIBDIR' is the VICE installation directory (usually
`/usr/local/lib/vice', `/usr/lib/vice' or
`/opt/vice/lib');

* `EMUID' is the emulation identification
 string (`C64',
`C128', `VIC20' or `PET');

* `BOOTPATH' is the directory where the binary lies (usually
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/bin' or `/opt/vice/bin').

* `DRIVES' is the directory called "DRIVES", where the disk
drive ROMs are.
 (The disk drive ROMs are used by all
emulators, so there is an extra
 directory for them.)

 Notice that the middle entry points to a default location in
the user's home directory. Here private ROM versions (e.g.
speeddos or JiffyDos) can be stored for example.
 
 *Note System
files::. for a description of the method used to load the
emulator's system files.
 

`HTMLBrowserCommand'
String specifying the command to run the help browser.  The help
browser
 can be any HTML browser, and every `%s' in the string is
replaced
 with the name of the toplevel file of the VICE
documentation.  For
 example, the default value `netscape %s'
runs Netscape Navigator.
 

`SaveResourcesOnExit'
Boolean specifying whether the emulator should save changed
settings
 before exiting.  If this is enabled, the user will be
always prompted
 first, in case the settings have changed.
 

`DoCoreDump'
Boolean specifying whether the emulator should dump core when it
gets a
 signal.
 

`JoyDevice1'
`JoyDevice2'
Integer specifying which joystick device the emulator should use
for
 joystick emulation for ports 1 and 2, respectively
(0=None, 1=Numpad, 2=Custom keys, 3=Analog joystick 1, 4=Analog
joystick 2,
 5=Digital joystick 1, 6=Digital joystick 2 on Unix)
The available joysticks might differ depending on operating system
and
 joystick support in the OS (Linux joystick module must be
available for example).


6.15.2 Miscellaneous command-line options
-----------------------------------------


`-directory SEARCHPATH'
Specify the system file search path (`Directory').

`-htmlbrowser COMMAND'
Specify the command to run the HTML browser for the on-line help
(`HTMLBrowserCommand').
 

`-saveres'
`+saveres'
Enable/disable automatic saving of settings on exit
(`SaveResourcesOnExit=1', `SaveResourcesOnExit=0').
 

`-confirmexit'
Confirm quiting VICE

`+confirmexit'
Never confirm quiting VICE
 

`-core'
`+core'
Enable/disable generation of core dumps (`DoCoreDump=1',
`DoCoreDump=0').


7 Machine-specific features
***************************



7.1 C64/128-specific commands and settings
==========================================


 
 This section lists the settings and commands that are C64/128
specific
 and thus are not present in the other emulators.
 



7.1.1 Using cartridges
----------------------


 The cartridge system is organized in "Slots" to allow more than one
cartridge
 connected at a time, like it can be done using an expansion
port expander on
 a real C64 (see below).
 
 Generally a cartridge
can be enabled by attaching its respective cartridge
 image, or using
the respective menu option for cartridges that do not
 require an
image.
 
 x64, x64sc and x128 allow you to attach the following kinds
of images:
* `.crt' images, as used by the CCS64 emulator by Per Hkan Sundell

* raw `.bin' images, with or without load address

 "Cartridge images" are like disk images, but contain the contents
of
 cartridge ROM and/or RAM images instead of disk images.
 
 To
attach cartridges, use the "Attach a cartridge image" submenu. When
using
 `.crt' images, this will work for every cartridge which is
supported. For
 raw `.bin' images you might have to use command line
options.
 
 When you have successfully attached a cartridge image,
you should then reset the machine to make sure the cartridge
initializes
 itself. (Or enable the "reset on cartridge change"
option).
 
 Of course, it is also possible to detach a currently
attached
 cartridge image ("Detach cartridge image").
 
 If you are
using a freezer cart like an Action Replay cartridge, you can
 emulate
the cartridge's freeze button with the "Cartridge freeze"
 command.

 The imaginary expansion port expander is organized in 4 slots, the
cartridges are associated with them like this:

7.1.1.1 Slot 0
..............


 All carts that have a passthrough connector go here. Once a "Slot
0"
 cartridge is enabled all further cartridges are connected to its
respective
 passthrough port.
 
 Only one cartridge of this type can
be active at a time.
 
 "Slot 0" carts have individual "enable"
switches, enabling means enabling permanently.
 
 The following
cartridges are emulated in this slot:
* IEEE-488 Interface
(`http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/c64/ieee-488/eprom.bin')

* Magic Voice

* MMC64


7.1.1.2 Slot 1
..............


 Mostly RAM based cartridges which for one reason or the other might
make sense
 to be enabled together with one of the "Main Slot"
cartridges go here.
 
 Only one cartridge of this type can be active
at a time.
 
 "Slot 1" carts have individual "enable" switches,
enabling means enabling permanently
 
 The following cartridges are
emulated in this slot:
* Double Quick Brown Box (DQBB)

* Expert Cartridge

* ISEPIC

* RamCart


7.1.1.3 Main Slot
.................


 All other cartridges which are not pure i/o extensions go here.
Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.
Cartridges in the "Main Slot" must be explicitly set as default to
enable them permanently.
 
 The following cartridges are emulated in
this slot:
* generic 4K, 8K and 16K game- and ultimax cartridges

* Action Replay V5

* Action Replay MK2

* Action Replay MK3

* Action Replay MK4

* Atomic Power

* C64 Games System

* Capture

* Comal 80

* Dela EP64

* Dela EP7x8

* Dela EP256

* Diashow-Maker

* Dinamic

* EasyFlash

* Epyx FastLoad

* EXOS

* The Final Cartridge

* The Final Cartridge III

* Final Cartridge Plus

* Freeze Frame

* Freeze Machine

* Fun Play

* Game Killer

* IDE64 (`http://www.volny.cz/dundera/')

* KCS Power Cartridge

* MACH 5

* Magic Desk

* Magic Formel

* Mikro Assembler

* MMC Replay

* Ocean

* Prophet64

* REX 256k EPROM Cart

* REX Utility

* Retro Replay

* ROSS

* Simons' BASIC

* Snapshot 64

* Stardos

* Structured BASIC

* Super Explode V5.0

* Super Games

* Super Snapshot V4

* Super Snapshot V5

* Warp Speed

* Westermann Learning

* Zaxxon


7.1.1.4 I/O Slot
................


 All carts that are pure I/O extensions go here.
 
 Any number of
"I/O Slot" Carts may be active at a time.
 
 "I/O Slot" carts have
individual "enable" switches, enabling means enabling permanently.
The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:
* ACIA (Swiftlink, Turbo232)

* DigiMAX

* Ethernet (The Final Ethernet, RR-Net)

* GEO-RAM

* MIDI (Passport, Datel, Maplin, Namesoft, Sequential)

* RAM Expansion Module (REU)

* SFX Sound Expander

* SFX Sound Sampler


7.1.1.5 Expected behaviour
..........................


 When the emulator is run without arguments, all settings from the
config file
 should be applied and arguments override settings from
the config file.
 
 When saving the settings to the config file it is
expected that on the next run
 of the emulator all settings will be in
the same state as they were when saved.
 
 There is an exception to
this rule: the cartridge in the "Main Slot" must be
 explicitly set as
default before it gets saved to the config file.
 
 `+cart' should
disable ALL cartridges, including eventually activated REU,
 Swithlink
and all similar expansionport devices.
 
 `-cartXYZ' options should
generally attach AND activate a cart of type XYZ.
 As a consequence,
attaching carts this way which are NOT in the "Main Slot" will
 also
enable the cart permanently. 

7.1.1.6 Common problems
.......................


 If attaching a cartridge does not work as expected, this may be
because of various
 reasons:


* Not seldomly the CRT type is incorrectly set in `.crt' files found
"in the wild".
 Make sure this is not the case (if in doubt use
`cartconv' to verify and/or fix).

* You may have unintentionally enabled more than one cartridge at
once, for
 example by saving the settings with REU enabled, and
then later attaching a game
 cartridge from the command-line. The
cartridge system will allow certain combinations,
 but (as on the
real thing) not all do (can) actually work. To make sure this is
not the case, either detach all cartridges from the menus, or use
`+cart'
 on the command-line.

* The cartridge image might be broken. Try one from a different
source. If you
 are sure the dump is ok (for example because you
dumped it yourself) then make sure
 it is in proper linear order
(on some cartridges, for example "capture", address and/or
 data
lines at the eprom are shuffled around so a dump made with an
eprom burner can not
 be used as is).

* Last not least you might have encountered a bug in the emulation.
If you
 suspect this is the case, and you can still reproduce the
bug after checking the
 things above, please file a bug report
including the following information:
* attach your vicerc and a reference to the cartridge binaries

* if you can, comment in the respective DEBUGXYZ macros
prominently defined at the
 top of these files:
src/c64/cart/c64cart.c src/c64/cart/c64cartmem.c
src/c64/c64io.c
 src/c64/c64export.c and then recompile.
this will add debug output that might make
 it much easier
to locate certain problems.



7.1.1.7 IEEE-488 interface
..........................


 To be able to use an IEEE drive, you need to enable IEEE emulation
for the
 emulator. To do this, follow the following steps:
Download the IEEE 488 ROM image from the CBM archives (formerly known
as FUNET)
 Attach that image with File/Attach cartridge image/IEEE488
interface image.
 
 Make sure you have a one-drive system only (that
is, go to Settings/Peripheral
 Setting, uncheck "use IEC device" for
all devices, go to Settings/Drive Settings
 and select "Floppy type"
as "none" for all drives other than drive 8.
 
 After this, all
drives can be selected in x64 and x128.

7.1.1.8 The Final Cartridge 3
.............................

The Final Cartridge 3 detects wether a mouse is connected when it
starts and
 disables mouse support if it doesnt detect one. So to make
mouse emulation
 work you must either enable it on the command line,
or reset the cartridge
 after enabling it from the user interface.

 used in both the C64 and the C128.


* "Sprite-sprite collisions" and "Sprite-background collisions", if
enabled, cause the hardware detection of sprite-to-sprite and
sprite-to-background collisions of the VIC-II to be emulated.
This
 feature is used by many games, and disabling either of the
two detection
 systems can sometimes make you invincible
(although there is also a
 chance that also enemies become
invincible then).
 

* "Color set" can be used to dynamically change the palette file
being used by choosing one of the available predefined color
sets:
* `default.vpl' ("default"), the default VICE palette;

* `c64s.vpl' ("C64S"), palette taken from the shareware C64S
emulator by Miha Peternel.

* `ccs64.vpl' ("CCS64"), palette taken from the shareware
CCS64
 emulator by Per Hkan Sundell.

* `frodo.vpl' ("Frodo"), palette taken from the free Frodo
emulator
 by Christian Bauer
(http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/FRMain.html).

* `pc64.vpl' ("PC64"), palette taken from the free PC64
emulator by
 Wolfgang Lorenz.

* `godot.vpl' ("GoDot"), palette as suggested by the authors of
the
 C64 graphics package GoDot
(http://users.aol.com/howtogodot/welcome.htm).

7.1.5 SID settings
------------------


 These settings control the emulation of the SID (MOS6581 or
MOS8580)
 audio chip.


* "Second SID" maps a second SID chip into the address space for
stereo
 sound. This emulates e.g. the "SID Symphony Stereo
Cartridge" from
 Dr. Evil Laboratories. The second SID can be
used with software such as
 "Stereo SID Player" by Mark Dickenson
or "The Enhanced Sidplayer" by
 Craig Chamberlain.
 

* "Second SID base address" sets the start address for the second
SID
 chip. Software normally uses $DE00 or $DF00, since
$DE00-$DEFF and
 $DF00-$DFFF can be mapped through the cartridge
port of the C64. The
 default start address is $DE00.
 

* "Emulate filters" causes the built-in programmable filters of the
SID
 chip to be emulated.  A lot of C64 music requires them to be
emulated
 properly, but their emulation requires some additional
processor power.
 

* "ChipModel" specifies the model of the SID chip being emulated:
there
 are two slightly different generations of SID chips:
MOS6581 ones and
 MOS8580 ones.
 

* "Use reSID emulation" specifies whether the more accurate (and
resource hungry) reSID emulation is turned on or off.
 

* "reSID sampling method" selects the method for conversion of the
SID
 output signal to a sampling rate appropriate for playback by
standard
 digital sound equipment. Possible settings are:
* "Fast" simply clocks the SID chip at the output sampling
frequency,
 picking the nearest sample. This yields
acceptable sound quality, but
 sampling noise is noticeable
in some cases, especially with SID combined
 waveforms. The
sound emulation is still cycle exact.

* "Interpolating" clocks the SID chip each cycle, and
calculates each
 sample with linear interpolation. The
sampling noise is now strongly
 attenuated by the SID
external filter (as long as "Emulate filters" is
 selected),
and the linear interpolation further improves the sound
quality.

* "Resampling" clocks the SID chip each cycle, and uses the
theoretically correct method for sample generation. This
delivers CD
 quality sound, but is extremely CPU intensive,
and is thus most useful
 for non-interactive sound
generation. Unless you have a very fast
 machine, that is.


* "reSID resampling passband" specifies the percentage of the
total bandwidth allocated to the resampling filter passband. The
work
 rate of the resampling filter is inversely proportional to
the remaining
 transition band percentage. This implies that e.g.
with the transition
 band starting at ~ 20kHz, it is faster to
generate 48kHz than 44.1kHz
 samples. For CD quality sound
generation at 44.1kHz the passband
 percentage should be set to
90 (i.e. the transition band starting at
 almost 20kHz).

7.1.6 C64 I/O extension settings
--------------------------------


 I/O extensions are (usually) cartridges which do not map into ROM
space,
 but use only the I/O space at address range $DE00 ... $DEFF
and/or
 $DF00 ... $DFFF.
 
 Please use these extensions only when
needed, as they might cause
 compatibility problems.
 
 The
following I/O extensions are available:


* ACIA (Swiftlink, Turbo232)
 

* DigiMAX
 

* Ethernet (The Final Ethernet, RR-Net)
 

* GEO-RAM
 

* MIDI (Passport, Datel, Maplin, Namesoft, Sequential)
 

* REU - 
 The "RAM Expansion Module" extension emulates a standard
Commodore RAM Expansion Unit; this can be used with GEOS and
other
 programs that are designed to take advantage of it.  This
currently
 works only in the C64 emulator.
 

* SFX Sound Expander
 

* SFX Sound Sampler

7.1.7 C64/128 system ROM settings
---------------------------------


 These settings can be used to control what system ROMs are loaded in
the
 C64/128 emulators at startup.  They cannot be changed from the
menus.
 

7.1.7.1 C64/128 system ROM resources
....................................




`KernalName'
String specifying the name of the Kernal ROM (default `kernal').

7.3 C64DTV-specific commands and settings
=========================================


 This section lists the settings and commands that are C64DTV
specific
 and thus are not present in the other emulators.
 
 

7.3.1 C64DTV ROM image
----------------------


 The DTV has a 2MB Flash chip which contains the kernal, basic and
character set ROMs along with other data, such as games in the case of
the original C64DTV ROM.
 
 The image file is a dump of the flash
chip. It is exactly 2MB (2097152 bytes).
 
 If you do not have a
suitable image file, an image using the C64 kernal,
 basic and charset
is automatically created.
 
 If writing to the C64DTV ROM is enabled,
the image file is rewritten with
 the current data when exiting
x64dtv.
 
 Note that x64dtv tries to load the image file from the
C64DTV
 directory first, and if it isn't found there, x64dtv tries to
load it from the current directory. If you do not have `dtvrom.bin'
in your C64DTV directory and writing to DTV ROM is enabled,
 the
`dtvrom.bin' file is created to the current directory.
 
 NOTE: The
original C64DTV ROM has somewhat distorted colors,
 normally you
should use a patched rom.


`-c64dtvromimage NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the C64DTV ROM image
 

`-c64dtvromrw'
`+c64dtvromrw'
Enable or disable writing to C64DTV ROM image

 The trueflashfs option is analogous to True drive emulation.  If
disabled,
 any file access to the flash filesystem (device 1) will go
to the local
 file system instead.


`-trueflashfs'
`+trueflashfs'
Enable or disable true hardware flash file system
 

`-fsflash NAME'
Specify `NAME' as directory for flash file system device


7.3.2 DTV revision
------------------


 The DTV revision 2 has a bug in the Blitter. Using revision 3
 is
recommended. Emulation of DTV revision 2 including Blitter
 bug is
intended for testing DTV software.


`-dtvrev REVISION'
Specify DTV `REVISION' (2 or 3)


7.3.3 LumaFix
-------------


 The PAL C64DTVs have wrong resistors in the video output circuit,
which causes incorrect luminances. Several hardware solutions
("LumaFixes") have been developed to fix this flaw.
 
 The fixed
video output is emulated by selecting "New Luminances".
 The
unmodified C64DTV video output can be emulated with "Old Luminances".

 The default setting is "New Luminances".
 

7.3.4 Userport
--------------


 The C64DTV userport emulation currently supports three devices:
Hummer ADC, userport joystick and PS/2 mouse.
 
 The joystick that
controls either the Hummer ADC or userport joystick
 can be selected
using the same parameter or menu option.
 
 While using the Hummer
ADC, joystick UP and DOWN are mapped to
 the Hummer buttons A and B
respectively. LEFT and RIGHT set the ADCs
 output to 0 and 255.
Centering the joystick results in the ADC value of 128.
 
 Currently
the Hummer ADC and userport joystick are mutually exclusive.
 This
means that enabling one disables the other. PS/2 mouse emulation
 can
be used simultaneously with either Hummer ADC or userport joystick.


`-hummeradc'
`+hummeradc'
Enable/Disable Hummer ADC
 

`-ps2mouse'
`+ps2mouse'
Enable or disable PS/2 mouse on userport


7.3.5 Debug
-----------


 Debugging information on Blitter, DMA and Flash can be enabled with
command
 line parameters. This can be useful for DTV software
development.


`-dtvblitterlog'
`+dtvblitterlog'
Enable or disable DTV Blitter log
 

`-dtvdmalog'
`+dtvdmalog'
Enable or disable DTV DMA log
 

`-dtvflashlog'
`+dtvflashlog'
Enable or disable DTV Flash log


7.3.6 Monitor DTV features
--------------------------


 Currently the registers A, Y and X are registers R0, R1 and R2
regardless of
 the mapping, which can be seen and modified via the
registers ACM and XYM.
 
 The monitor can access all 2MB of RAM and
2MB of Flash, but only 64 kB at a time.
 The 64kB bank can be selected
with "bank ram00".."ram1f" for RAM and
 "bank rom00".."rom1f" for
Flash.
 
 The "load" command can load large files (>64kB) correctly
if the bank is set
 to "ramXX", where XX is the starting bank (usually
"bank00").
 

7.4 VIC20-specific commands and settings
========================================


 This section lists the settings and commands that are VIC20-specific
and
 thus are not present in the other emulators.
 
 

7.4.1 Using cartridge images
----------------------------


 As with the C64 (*note C64 cartridges::), it is possible to attach
several types of cartridge images:
* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $2000;

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $4000;

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $6000;

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $A000;

* 4 Kbyte cartridges located at $B000.

 This can all be done via the "Attach cartridge image..." command
in
 the left-button menu.  It is also possible to let xvic "guess"
the
 type of cartridge using "Smart-attach cartridge image...".
Notice that several cartridges are actually made up of two pieces (and
two files), that need to be loaded separately at different addresses.
In that case, you have to know the addresses (which are usually
specified in the file name) and use the "attach" command twice.
 
 A
special kind of cartridge file is where the two files mentioned
 above
are concatenated (with removing the two byte load address of
 the
second image) into one 16k image. There are only few of those
 images,
though. Normally the second part is located at $A000. 
 Vice can now
attach such concatenated files at the start address
 $2000, $4000, and
$6000. The second half of such an image is
 moved to $A000. If you
encounter 16k images that have the second
 half not at $A000 you can
split the image into two halfs 
 (i.e. one 8194 byte and one 8192
byte, because the first has the load
 address) and attach both files
separately.
 
 One cartridge that is currently only partially
supported here is

7.4.4 Changing memory configuration
-----------------------------------


 It is possible to change the VIC20 memory configuration in two ways:
by
 enabling and/or disabling certain individual memory blocks, or by
choosing one among a few typical memory configurations.  The former
can
 be done by modifying resource values directly or from the
right-button
 menu; the latter can only be done from the menu.
There are 5 RAM expansion blocks in the VIC20, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 and
5:
* block 0 (3 Kbytes at $0400-$0FFF);

* block 1 (8 Kbytes at $2000-$3FFF);

* block 2 (8 Kbytes at $4000-$5FFF);

* block 3 (8 Kbytes at $6000-$7FFF);

* block 5 (8 Kbytes at $A000-$BFFF).

 These blocks are called "expansion blocks" because they are not
present a stock ("unexpanded") machine.  Each of them is associated to
a boolean `RamBlockX' resource (where `X' is the block number)
 that
specifies whether the block is enabled or not.
 
 There are also some
common memory configurations you can pick from the
 right-button
menu:
* no RAM expansion blocks at all;

* all RAM expansion blocks enabled;

* 3K expansion (only block 0 is enabled);

* 8K expansion (only block 1 is enabled);

* 16K expansion (only blocks 1 and 2 are enabled);

* 24K expansion (only blocks 1, 2 and 3 are enabled).


7.4.4.1 VIC20 memory configuration resources
............................................




`RAMBlock0'
`RAMBlock1'
`RAMBlock2'
`RAMBlock3'
`RAMBlock5'
Booleans specifying whether RAM blocks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 must be
enabled.


7.4.4.2 VIC20 memory configuration command-line options
.......................................................




`-memory CONFIG'
Specify memory configuration.  It must be a comma-separated list
of
 options, each of which can be one the following:
* `none' (no extension);

* `all' (all blocks);

* `3k' (3k space in block 0);

* `8k' (first 8k extension block);

* `16k' (first and second 8k extension blocks);

* `24k' (first, second and 3rd extension blocks);

* `0', `1', `2', `3', `5' (memory in respective
 blocks);

* `04', `20', `40', `60', `A0' (memory at
 respective
address.

 For example,
xvic -memory none

 gives an unexpanded VIC20.  While
xvic -memory 60,a0

 or
xvic -memory 3,5

 enables memory in blocks 3 and 5, which is the usual
configuration for
 16k ROM modules.

7.6 PET-specific commands and settings
======================================


 This section lists the settings and commands that are PET-specific
and
 thus are not present in the other emulators.
 

7.6.1 Changing PET model settings
---------------------------------


 With `xpet', it is possible to change at runtime the
characteristics of the emulated PET so that it matches (or not) the
ones
 of a certain PET model, and it is also possible to select from a
common
 set of PET models so that all the features are selected
accordingly.
 
 The former is done by changing the following
resources (via resource
 file, command line options or right-menu
items):


`RamSize'
Size of memory in kByte. 96k denotes a 8096, 128k a 8296.
 

`IOSize'
Size of I/O area in Byte.  Either 2048 or 256 for 8296.
 

`VideoSize'
The number of columns on the screen (40 or 80).  A 0 auto-detects
this
 from the ROM.
 

`Ram9'
The 8296 can map RAM into the address range $9***
 

`RamA'
The 8296 can map RAM into the address range $A***
 

`SuperPET'
This resource enables the SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) I/O
 and
disables the 8x96 mappings.
 

`Basic1'
If (by checksum) a version 1 kernal is detected, then the
kernal ROM is patched to make the IEEE488 interface work.
 

`Basic1Chars'
Exchanges some character in the character ROM that have changed
between the first PET 2001 and all newer versions.
 

`EoiBlank'
This resource enables the "blank screen on EOI" feature of the
oldest PET 2001.
 

`DiagPin'
Set the diagnositc pin on the PET userport (see below).
 

`ChargenName'
Specify `NAME' as the character generator ROM file
 

`KernalName'
Specify `NAME' as the kernal ROM file.  This file contains the
complete BASIC, EDITOR and KERNAL ROMs and is either 16k (BASIC 1
and 2)
 or 20k (BASIC 4) in size.
 

`EditorName'
Specify `NAME' as the editor ROM file.  This file contains
 an
overlay for the editor ROM at $E000-$E7FF if necessary.
 

`RomModule9Name'
Specify `NAME' as the $9*** Expansion ROM file.  This file
contains
 an expansion ROM image of 4k.
 

`RomModuleAName'
Specify `NAME' as the $A*** Expansion ROM file.  This file
contains
 an expansion ROM image of 4k.
 

`RomModuleBName'
Specify `NAME' as the $B*** Expansion ROM file.  This file
contains
 an expansion ROM image of 4k.
 This file overlays the
lowest 4k of a BASIC 4 ROM.

 Choosing a common PET model is done from the right-button menu
instead,
 by choosing an item from the "Model defaults" submenu.
Available
 models are:
* PET 2001-8N

* PET 3008

* PET 3016

* PET 3032

* PET 3032B

* PET 4016

* PET 4032

* PET 4032B

* PET 8032

* PET 8096

* PET 8296

* SuperPET

 Notice that this will *reset the emulated machine*.
 
 It is
also possible to select the PET model at startup, with the
 `-model'
command-line option: for example, `xpet -model 3032'
 will emulate a
PET 3032 while `xpet -model 8296' will emulate a PET
 8296.

 It is possible to enable or disable emulation of the PET diagnostic
pin
 via the `DiagPin' resource, or the "PET userport diagnostic pin"
item in the right-button menu.
 
 When the diagnostic pin is set, the
Kernal does not try to initialize
 the BASIC, but directly jumps into
the builtin machine monitor.

7.6.5 Changing screen colors
----------------------------


 It is also possible to choose what color set is used for the
emulation
 window.  This is done by specifying a palette file name
(*note Palette files::) in the `PaletteName' resource.  The menu
provides the
 following values:
* `green.vpl' (default, "green)"), the good old green-on-black
feeling;

* `amber.vpl' ("amber"), an amber phosphor lookalike;

* `white.vpl' ("white"), simple white-on-black palette.


7.7 CBM-II-specific commands and settings
=========================================


 This section lists the settings and commands that are
CBM-II-specific and
 thus are not present in the other emulators.


7.7.1 Changing CBM-II model
---------------------------


 With `xcbm2', it is possible to change at runtime the
characteristics of the emulated CBM so that it matches (or not) the
ones
 of a certain CBM model, and it is also possible to select from a
common
 set of CBM models so that all the features are selected
accordingly.
 
 The former is done by changing the following
resources (via resource
 file, command line options or right-menu
items):


`UseVicII'
Whether to use VIC-II for video output (value 1) or the CRTC for
the
 other machines (value 0)
 

`RamSize'
Size of memory in kByte.  Possible values are 128, 256, 512 and
1024
 

`Ram08, Ram1, Ram2, Ram4, Ram6, RamC'
Expanded CBM-II models could map RAM to the expansion ROM areas
at $0800-$0fff, $1000-$1fff, $2000-$3FFF, $4000-$5FFF,
$6000-$7FFF
 and $c000-$cfff respectively.
 

`Cart2Name, Cart4Name, Cart6Name'
Specify `NAME' as the $2000-$3FFF, $4000-$5FFF or $6000-$6FFF
Expansion ROM file.  This file contains an 8k ROM dump.
 

`ModelLine'
The CBM-II business models have two hardcoded lines at one of the
I/O ports.
 From those lines the kernal determines how it should
init the 
 CRTC video chip for either 50Hz (Europe) or 60Hz
(North America),
 and either for 8 (C6x0) or 14 (C7x0) scanlines
per character.
 0 = CBM 7x0 (50Hz), 1 = 60Hz C6x0, 2 = 50Hz
C6x0).

 Choosing a common CBM-II model is done from the right-button menu
instead,
 by choosing an item from the "Model defaults" submenu.
Available
 models are:
* C510 (128k RAM)

* C610 (128k RAM)

* C620 (256k RAM)

* C620+ (1024k RAM, expanded)

* C710 (128k RAM)

* C720 (256k RAM)

* C720+ (1024k RAM, expanded)

 Notice that this will *reset the emulated machine*.
 
 Warning:
At this time switching between 510 and other machines during
 runtime
is not supported and will not work.
 
 It is also possible to select
the CBM model at startup, with the
 `-model' command-line option: for
example, `xcbm2 -model 610'
 will emulate a CBM 610 while `xcbm2
-model 620' will emulate a CBM
 620. Notably this is the only way to
start a C510 emulation, with
 `-model 510'.

8 Snapshots
***********


 Every VICE emulator has a built-in snapshot feature, that saves the
complete emulator state into one file for later use.
 You can
therefore save the emulator state - including the state of
 the game
you are playing for example - in a single file. 
 

8.1 Snapshot usage
==================


 A snapshot is one file containining the complete emulator state.  A
snapshot file can be generated by selecting the "Save snapshot"
command at any time.  This will pop up a requester from which you can
specify whether the snapshot should also contain the disk and ROM
status.
 
 A snapshot file can be used to restore the emulator state
by selecting
 the `load snapshot' menu entry at any time.
Unfortunately attached ROM images/cartridges are only supported in the
VIC20,
 the PET and the CBM-II emulators at this time.
 
 The memory
configuration of the emulator is saved in the snapshot file as
 well.
This configuration is restored when the snapshot is loaded.
 
 A
quick snapshot can now be made by pressing the `M-F11' key and
reloaded by pressing the `M-F10' key. 

8.2 Snapshot format
===================


 A snapshot file consists of several modules of mostly different
types.
 Each module has a name and saves the state of an entity like a
CIA, the CPU, 
 or the memory.
 

8.2.1 Emulator modules

but
 not both. Currently switching between the two video emulations is
not
 possible at runtime, so only snapshots that fit the current
UseVicII 
 resource are accepted.

8.2.1.6 Drive modules
.....................


 The modules for the real disk drive emulation are included in the
emulator
 when the emulation is enabled during the writing of the
snapshot.
Name    Type                          Description
*CPU    6502                          The Drive 0 CPU
*       *                             *


8.2.2 Module formats
--------------------


 This section shows the basic module framework and the contents of
the
 different types of modules.
 
 The single chip modules contain
the chip state, not the state of the
 emulator.  We tried to make the
format as implementation-independent as
 possible, to allow reuse of
snapshots in later versions of this
 emulator, or even in other
emulators.
 

8.2.2.1 Terminology
...................


 In this section we use certain abbreviations to define the types of
the
 data saved in the snapshot.
`BYTE'
8 bit integer.

`WORD'
16 bit integer.  Saved with low-byte first, high-byte last.

`DWORD'
32 bit integer.  Saved with low-word first, then high-word.  Each
word saved with its low-byte first.

`ARRAY'
Array of BYTE values.  Length depends on the description.

 The tables for the single modules state the type, name and
description
 of the data saved in the modules.  The data is saved in
the order it is
 in the tables, so no offset is given.

8.2.2.2 Module framework
........................


 The VICE snapshot file starts with the magic string and includes
the
 fileformat version number.
Type    Name                          Description
19      MAGIC                         "VICE Snapshot File032", padded
BYTE                                  with 0
BYTE    VMAJOR                        fileformat major version number
BYTE    VMINOR                        fileformat minor version number
16      MACHINENAME                   Name of emulated machine, like
BYTE                                  "PET", "CBM-II", "VIC20", "C64" or
"C128". zerobyte-padded.

 The file header is followed by a number of different snapshot
modules.
 
 Each module has a header with the information given in
the table below.
 The header includes two version numbers, VMAJOR and
VMINOR.  Modules
 with the same VMAJOR should be able to be exchanged.
I.e. higher VMINOR
 numbers only append to the data for lower VMINOR.
This additional data
 is ignored by older restore routines.  The other
way around newer
 restore routines must accept the fewer info from
lower VMINOR dumps.
 Changes in VMAJOR might introduce any
incompatibility you like, but
 that's what VMAJOR is for after all
:-)
Type    Name                          Description
16      MODULENAME                    The name of the module in ASCII,
BYTE                                  padded with 0 to 16 byte.
BYTE    VMAJOR                        major version number
BYTE    VMINOR                        minor version number
DWORD   SIZE                          size of the module, including this
header


8.2.2.3 CPU module
..................


 This module saves the core 6502 state.  You will find a clock value
there.  All other modules save their own clock values relative to this
value.  However, the drive modules save their clocks relative to their
appropriate CPUs of course.
 
 Warning: This module is still under
construction and saves some
 information that is not sure to be
VICE-independent.  If in doubt, read
 the source.
Type    Name                          Description
DWORD   CLK                           the current CPU clock value.  All
other clock values are relative to
this.

due
 to the improved CIA emulation in the newer VICE versions. 
 Some
state bits correspond to the CIA state as described in the
 "A
Software Model of the CIA 6526" document by Wolfgang Lorenz,
 some are
delayed versions. For more read the source file 
 `ciatimer.h'.

 Warning: This module is still under construction.

8.2.2.10 ACIA module
....................


 The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip.  VICE emulates RS232
connections
 via `/dev/ttyS*' (Unix) or `COM:' (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.
 The
state of the ACIA however is restored if possible.  I.e. if a
connection
 is already open when restoring the snapshot, this
connection is used
 instead.  If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR
drop is emulated.

 Warning: After VICE version 1.0 the CRTC emulation has improved
considerably. Especially it is now cycle exact. Therefore a lot more
variables must be saved. The snapshot module version jumped from

to 1.0. Newer versions of VICE can read the old snapshots, but
 older
versions (1.0 and below) cannot read the new snapshots.

 The RAM* arrays are only saved if the RAM itself is less than
1M.
 If the memory size is 1M then those areas are taken from the
bank 15 area of the normal RAM.
 
 The memory array starts at $10000
if the memory size is less than 512k,
 or at $00000 if 512k or more.
In case of a C510, then the memory array
 also always starts at
$00000.

11 Monitor
**********


 Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be
used
 to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs,
as
 well as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by
using
 the "Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that
you
 have to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such
as
 `rxvt' or `xterm') in order to use the monitor.
 
 Warning: this
version of the monitor is still under construction,
 and some of the
features are not fully working yet.
 

11.1 Terminology
================




`address_space'
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of
registers.
 This can be the addresses available to the computer's
processor, the
 disk drive's processor or a specific memory
configuration of one of
 the mentioned processors.

`bankname'
The CPU can only see 64k of memory at any one time, due to its 16
bit
 address bus. The C64 and other computers have more than this
amount,
 and this is handled by banking: a memory address can
have different
 contents, depending on the active memory bank.
A bankname names a specific bank in the current address_space.

`register'
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

`address'
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

`address_range'
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both
addresses
 must be in the same address space.

`address_opt_range'
An address or an address range.

`label'
`label' is the name of a label. it must start with a dot (".")
in order for the monitor to recognize it as a label.

`prompt'
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from
the
 monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The
second part
 of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.


`checkpoint'
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an
action
 when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types
of
 checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

`breakpoint'
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it
is
 triggered, the monitor is entered.

`tracepoint'
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

`watchpoint'
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.
When
 a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

`memmap'
The memmap keeps track of RAM/ROM/IO read/write/execute
accesses. The feature must be enabled with "-enable-memmap"
configure option, as it might decrease performance notably on
slower hardware. The option also enables CPU history.

`<...>'
A data type.

`*'
Zero or more occurrences.

`[...]'
An optional argument.


11.2 Machine state commands
===========================




`backtrace'
`bt'
Print JSR call chain (most recent call first). Stack offset
relative to SP+1 is printed in parentheses. This is a best guess
only.

`cpuhistory [<count>]'
`chis [<count>]'
Show <count> last executed commands.
 (disabled by default;
configure with -enable-memmap to enable)

`dump "<filename>"'
Write a snapshot of the machine into the file specified.
 This
snapshot is compatible with a snapshot written out by the UI.
Note: No ROM images are included into the dump.

`goto <address>'
`g <address>'
Change the PC to address and continue execution.

`io [<address>]'
Display i/o registers. Invoking without an address shows a dump
of
 the entire io range, if an address is given then details for
the
 chip at the respective (base-)address are displayed (if
available).

`next [<count>]'
`n [<count>]'
Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as a
single
 instruction.

`registers [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
`r [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
Assign respective registers.  With no parameters, display
register
 values.

`reset [<type>]'
Reset the machine or drive.
 `type': 0 = soft, 1 = hard, 8-11 =
drive.

`return'
`ret'
Continues execution  and returns to the monitor just
 after the
next RTS or RTI is executed.

`step [<count>]'
`z [<count>]'
Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows
stepping
 more than a single instruction at a time.

`undump "<filename>"'
Read a snapshot of the machine from the file specified.


11.3 Memory commands
====================




`bank [<bankname>]'
Without a bankname, display all available banks for the current
address_space. With a bankname given, switch to the specified
bank. If a bank is not completely filled (ROM banks for example)
normally the `ram' bank is used where the bank has holes.
 The
`cpu' bank uses the bank currently used by the CPU.

`compare <address_range> <address>'
`c <address_range> <address>'
Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to
the
 destination specified by the address.  The regions may
overlap.  Any
 values that miscompare are displayed using the
default displaytype.

`device [c:|8:|9:]'
Set the default address space to either the computer `c:' or the
specified drive `8:' or `9:'

`fill <address_range> <data_list>'
`f <address_range> <data_list>'
Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
<data_list>.  If the size of the address range is greater than
the
 size of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

`hunt <address_range> <data_list>'
`h <address_range> <data_list>'
Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
<data_list>.  If the data is found, the starting address of the
match
 is displayed.  The entire range is searched for all
possible matches.
 The data list may have `xx' as a wildcard.

`i <address_opt_range>'
Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

`ii <address_opt_range>'
Display memory contents as screen code text

`mem [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`m [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the
default
 is used.  If only one address is specified, the length
of data
 displayed is based on the datatype.  If no addresses are
given, the
 'dot' address is used.

`memmapshow [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`mmsh [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Show the memmap. The mask can be specified to show only those
locations with accesses of certain type(s). The mask is a number
with the bits "ioRWXrwx", where RWX are for ROM and rwx for RAM.
Optionally, an address range can be specified.
 (disabled by
default; configure with -enable-memmap to enable)

`memmapzap'
`mmzap'
Clear the memmap.
 (disabled by default; configure with
-enable-memmap to enable)

`memmapsave "<filename>" <format>'
`mmsave "<filename>" <format>'
Save the memmap as a picture. `format':
 0 = BMP, 1 = PCX, 2 =
PNG, 3 = GIF, 4 = IFF.
 (disabled by default; configure with
-enable-memmap to enable)

`memchar [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`mc [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one
address
 is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no
addresses are
 given, the "dot" address is used.

`memsprite [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`ms [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one
address is
 specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no
addresses are given,
 the "dot" address is used.

`move <address_range> <address>'
`t <address_range> <address>'
Move memory from the source specified by the address range to the
destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.


`screen'
`sc'
Displays the contents of the screen.

`sidefx [on|off|toggle]'
`sfx [on|off|toggle]'
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that
have
 read side-effects, like CIA interrupt registers for
example.  
 If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause
side-effects.  If the
 argument is 'off' then reads don't cause
side-effects.  If the
 argument is 'toggle' then the current mode
is switched.  No argument
 displays the current state.

`> [<address>] <data_list>'
Write the specified data at `address'.


11.4 Assembly commands
======================




`a <address> [ <instruction> [: <instruction>]* ]'
Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line
to
 exit assembly mode).

`disass [<address> [<address>]]'
`d [<address> [<address>]]'
Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they
are
 used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified,
it is
 treated as the start address and a default number of
instructions are
 disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a
default number of
 instructions are disassembled from the dot
address.


11.5 Checkpoint commands
========================




`break [<address> [if <cond_expr>] ]'
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid
checkpoints
 are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint
is set for that
 address and the breakpoint number is printed.  A
conditional
 expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
For more
 information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.


`enable <checknum>'

`disable <checknum>'
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
changing between these states.

`command <checknum> "<command>"'
When checkpoint `checknum' is hit, the specified command is
executed by the monitor.  Note that the `x' command is not yet
supported as a command argument.

`condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
`cond <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the
expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint
is
 examined, not when the condition is set.
 
 Currently, the
cond_expr is very limited. You can use registers (.A, .X,
 .Y,
.PC, and .SP) and compare against other registers or absolute
values. For example, the following are all valid conditions:
 .A
== 0, .X == .Y, 8:.X == .X, .A != 5, .A < .X.
 
 However, you
cannot specify memory contents and compare that.
 

`delete <checknum>'
`del <checknum>'
Delete the specified checkpoint.

`ignore <checknum> [<count>]'
Ignore a checkpoint after a given number of crossings.  If no
count is
 given, the default value is 1.

`trace [address [address]]'
`tr [address [address]]'
This command is similar to the `break' command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint
by
 not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the
user an
 execution trace.  The second optional address can be
used to specify
 the end of an range of addresses to be traced.


`until [<address>]'
`un [<address>]'
If no address is given, the currently valid breakpoints are
printed.
 If an address is given, a temporary breakpoint is set
for that address
 and the breakpoint number is printed.  Control
is returned to the
 emulator by this command.  The breakpoint is
deleted once it is hit.

`watch [loadstore] [address [address]]'
`w [loadstore] [address [address]]'
This command is similar to the previous two commands except that
it
 operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from the
others by
 stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range
of addresses.
 If no addresses are given, a list of all the
watchpoints is printed.
 The loadstore parameter can be either
"load" or "store" to determine
 on which operation the monitor
breaks. If not specified, the monitor
 breaks on both
operations.


11.6 General commands
=====================




`cd <directory>'
Change the working directory.

`device [c:|d:]'
`dev [c:|d:]'
Set the default memory device to either the computer (`c:') or
the disk (`d:').

`dir [<directory>]'
`ls [<directory>]'
Display the directory contents.

`pwd'
Show current working directory.

`radix [H|D|O|B]'
`rad [H|D|O|B]'
Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
argument, the current radix is printed.


11.7 Disk commands
==================




`attach <filename> <device>'
Attach file to device. (device 32 = cart)

`block_read <track> <sector> [<address>]'
`br <track> <sector> [<address>]'
Read the block at the specified track and sector.  If an address
is
 specified, the data is loaded into memory.  If no address is
given,
 the data is displayed using the default datatype.

`block_write <track> <sector> <address>'
`bw <track> <sector> <address>'
Write a block of data at `address' to the specified track and
sector of disk in drive 8.

`detach <device>'
Detach file from device. (device 32 = cart)

`@<disk command>'
Perform a disk command on the currently attached disk image on
drive
 8.  The specified disk command is sent to the drive's
channel #15.

`load "<filename>" <device> [<address>]'
`l "<filename>" <device> [<address>]'
Load the specified file into memory.  If no address is given, the
file
 is loaded to the address specified by the first two bytes
read from
 the file.  If address is given, the file is loaded to
the specified
 address and the first two bytes read from the file
are skipped.  If
 device is 0, the file is read from the file
system.

`list [<directory>]'
List disk contents.

`bload "<filename>" <device> <address>'
`bl "<filename>" <device> <address>'
Load the specified file into memory at the specified address.
 If
device is 0, the file is read from the file system.

`save "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
`s "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.
Write two-byte load address.
 If device is 0, the file is written
to the file system.

`bsave "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
`bs "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.
If device is 0, the file is written to the file system.


11.8 Command file commands
==========================




`playback "<filename>"'
`pb "<filename>"'
Monitor commands from the specified file are read and executed.
This
 command stops at the end of file or when a STOP command is
read.

`record "<filename>"'
`rec "<filename>"'
After this command, all commands entered are written to the
specified
 file until the STOP command is entered.

`stop'
Stop recording commands.  See `record'.


11.9 Label commands
===================




`add_label <address> <label>'
`al <address> <label>'
Map a given address to a label.  This label can be used when
entering
 assembly code and is shown during disassembly.
Additionally, it can
 be used whenever an address must be
specified.
 
 <label> is the name of the label; it must start
with a dot (".") in
 order for the monitor to recognize it as a
label.

`delete_label [<memspace>] <label>'
`dl [<memspace>] <label>'
Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no memory
space is
 checked, all tables are checked.

`load_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
`ll [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no
memory
 space is specified, the default readspace is used.
The file must contain commands the monitor understands, e.g.
add_label. The
 compiler cc65 can create such label files.
Vice can also load label files created by the Acme assembler.
Their syntax is
 e.g. "labelname = $1234 ; Maybe a comment". A
dot will be added automatically
 to label names assigned in this
way to fit to the Vice label syntax. Normally
 the semicolon
seperates commands but after an assignment of this kind it may be
used to start a comment to end of line, so unchanged Acme label
files can be
 fed into Vice.

`save_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
`sl [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
Save labels to a file.  If no memory space is specified, all of
the
 labels are saved.

`show_labels [<memspace>]'
`shl [<memspace>]'
Display current label mappings.  If no memory space is specified,
show
 all labels.


11.10 Miscellaneous commands
============================




`cartfreeze'
Use cartridge freeze.

`cpu <type>'
Specify the type of CPU currently used (6502/z80).

`exit'
`x'
Leave the monitor and return to execution.

Display the specified number in decimal, hex, octal and binary.



12 c1541
********


 VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called `c1541'.
 
 You can either invoke it from the
command
 line or from within one of the VICE emulators, using the "Run
c1541"
 command which will open a new `xterm' window with a running
`c1541' in it.
 
 The syntax is:
c1541 [IMAGE1 [IMAGE2]] [COMMAND1 COMMAND2 ... COMMANDN]

 `IMAGE1' and `IMAGE2' are disk image names that can be
 attached
before `c1541' starts.  `c1541' can handle up to
 two disk images at
the same time by using two virtual built-in drives,
 numbered `8' and
`9'; `IMAGE1' (if present) is always
 attached to drive `8', while
`IMAGE2' is attached to drive
 `9'.
 
 `COMMAND's specified on the
command-line all begin with the minus
 sign (`-'); if present, `c1541'
executes them in the same
 order as they are on the command line and
returns a zero error code if
 they were successful.  If any of the
`COMMAND's fails, `c1541'
 stops and returns a nonzero error code.
If no `COMMAND's are specified at all, `c1541' enters
 interactive
mode, where you can type commands manually.  Commands in
 interactive
mode are the same as commands in batch mode, but do not
 require a
leading `-'.  As with the monitor, file name completion
 and command
line editing with history are provided via GNU
 `readline'.  Use the
command `quit' or press `C-d' to
 exit.
 

12.1 Specifying files in c1541
==============================


 When accessing CBM DOS files (i.e. files that reside on disk
images),
 c1541 uses a special syntax that lets you access files on
both drive 8
 and 9.  If you prepend the file name with `@8:' or
`@9:', you
 will specified that file is to be found or created on
drive 8 and 9,
 respectively.
 
 For instance,
@8:somefile

 will name file named `somefile' on unit 8, while
@9:somefile

 will name file named `somefile' on unit 9.

12.2 Using quotes and backslashes
=================================


 You can use quotes (`"') in a command to embed spaces into file
names.  For instance,
read some file

 will read file `some' from the disk image and write it into the
file system as `file', while
read "some file"

 will copy `some file' into the file system, with the name
 `some
file'.
 
 The backslash character (`') has a special meaning too: it
lets
 you literally insert the following character no matter what it
is.  For
 example,
read some file

 will copy file `some file' into the file system, while
read some file this"file

 will copy `some file' into the file system with name
`this"file' (with an embedded quote).
 

12.3 c1541 commands and options
===============================


 This is a list of the `c1541' commands.  They are shown in their
interactive form, without the leading `-'.
 Square brackets []
indicate an optional part, and "<COMMAND>" translates
 to a disk
command according to CBM DOS, like "i0" for example.


` [<command>]'
Execute specified CBM DOS command and print the current status of
the
 drive.  If no `command' is specified, just print the
status.

`? [<command>]'
Explain specified command.  If no command is specified, list
available
 ones.

`attach <diskimage> [<unit>]'
Attach `diskimage' to `unit' (default unit is 8).

`block <track> <sector> <disp> [<drive>]'
Show specified disk block in hex form.

`copy <source1> [<source2> ... <sourceN>] <destination>'
Copy `source1' ... `sourceN' into destination.  If N > 1,
`destination' must be a simple drive specifier (`@n:').

`delete <file1> [<file2> ... <fileN>]'
Delete the specified files.

`exit'
Exit (same as `quit').

`extract'
Extract all the files to the file system.

`format <diskname,id> [<type> <imagename>] [<unit>]'
If `unit' is specified, format the disk in unit `unit'.  If
`type' and `imagename' are specified, create a new image named
`imagename', attach it to unit 8 and format it.  `type' is a
disk image type, and must be either `x64', `d64' (both
VC1541/2031), 
 `g64' (VC1541/2031 but in GCR coding), `d71'
(VC1571), `d81'
 (VC1581), `d80' (CBM8050) or `d82'
(CBM8250/1001). 
 Otherwise, format the disk in the current unit,
if any.

`gcrformat <diskname,id> <imagename>'
Create and format a G64 disk image named `imagename'.

`help [<command>]'
Explain specified command.  If no command is specified, list
available
 ones.

`info [<unit>]'
Display information about unit `unit' (if unspecified, use the
current

12.4 Executing shell commands
=============================


 If you want to execute a shell command from withing `c1541', just
prepend it with an exclamation mark (`!').  For example,
!ls -la

 will execute the command `ls -la', which will show you all the
files in the current directory.

12.5 c1541 examples
===================


`c1541 -attach test.d64 -write test.prg testfile'
Write `test.prg' to `test.d64' as `testfile'.


13 cartconv
***********


 The cartconv program is a cartridge conversion utility, it can
convert
 between binary and .crt images and it can 'insert' binary
and/or
 .crt images into the EPROM type of cartridges.

13.1 cartconv command line options
==================================


 The cartconv program has the following parameters:
`-i "input name"'
This parameter is mandatory, it should contain the name of the
binary/.crt
 file you want to convert. For the EPROM type of
cartridges this parameter
 can be used multiple times to insert
images into the resulting file.

`-o "output name"'
This parameter is mandatory, it should contain the name of the
binary/.crt
 file you want to convert the input file to.

`-t carttype'
This parameter is optional. It is only needed when converting to a
.crt
 file. See below for the supported cartridge types.

`-n "cart name"'
This parameter is optional and is used as the cartridge name when
creating
 a .crt file.

`-l loadaddress'
This parameter is optional and is used as the load-address when
converting
 a .crt file to a .prg file, or when converting to a
generic type .crt
 file.

`-f "input name"'
This parameter is optional, and is meant to output information
about the
 named file. It can't be used in conjuction with any of
the other parameters.

15 The emulator file formats
****************************


 This chapter gives a technical description of the various files
supported by the emulators.
 

15.1 The T64 tape image format
==============================


 (This section was taken from the C64S distribution.)
 
 The `T64'
File Structure was developed by Miha Peternel for use in
 the C64S
emulator.  It is easy to use and allows future extensions.

64                     32*n                   file records for n directory
entries
64+32*n                varies                 binary contents of the
files


15.1.2 Tape Record

16                     16                     C64 file name

 Valid entry types are:
Code                   Explanation
`0'                    free entry
`1'                    normal tape file
`2'                    tape file with header: header is saved just
before file data
`3'                    memory snapshot v0.9, uncompressed
`4'                    tape block
`5'                    digitized stream
`6' ... `255'          reserved

 Notes:
* VICE only supports file type `1'.

* Types `3', `4' and `5' are subject to change (and
 are rarely
used).


15.2 The G64 GCR-encoded disk image format
==========================================


 (This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited
by
 Ettore Perazzoli.)
 
 This format was defined in 1998 as a
cooperative effort between several
 emulator people, mainly Per Hkan
Sundell, author of the CCS64 C64
 emulator, Andreas Boose of the VICE
CBM emulator team and Joe
 Forster/STA, the author of Star Commander.
It was the first real public
 attempt to create a format for the
emulator community which removed
 almost all of the drawbacks of the
other existing image formats, namely
 `D64'.
 
 The intention behind
`G64' is not to replace the widely used
 `D64' format, as `D64' works
fine with the vast majority of
 disks in existence.  It is intended
for those small percentage of
 programs which demand to work with the
1541 drive in a non-standard way,
 such as reading or writing data in
a custom format.  The best example is
 with speeder software such as
Action Cartridge in Warp Save mode or
 Vorpal which write track/sector
data in another format other than
 standard GCR.  The other obvious
example is copy-protected software
 which looks for some specific data
on a track, like the disk ID, which
 is not stored in a standard `D64'
image.
 
 `G64' has a deceptively simply layout for what it is
capable of
 doing.  We have a signature, version byte, some predefined
size values,
 and a series of offsets to the track data and speed
zones.  It is what's
 contained in the track data areas and speed
zones which is really at the
 heart of this format.
 
 Each track
entry in simply the raw stream of GCR data, just what a read
 head
would see when a diskette is rotating past it.  How the data gets
interpreted is up to the program trying to access the disk.  Because
the
 data is stored in such a low-level manner, just about anything
can be
 done.  Most of the time I would suspect the data in the track
would be
 standard sectors, with SYNC, GAP, header, data and
checksums.  The
 arrangement of the data when it is in a standard GCR
sector layout is
 beyond the scope of this document.
 
 Since it is
a flexible format in both track count and track byte size,
 there is
no "standard" file size.  However, given a few constants like
 42
tracks and halftracks, a track size of 7928 bytes and no speed offset
entries, the typical file size will a minimum of 333744 bytes.
Below is a dump of the header, broken down into its various parts.
After that will be an explanation of the track offset and speed zone
offset areas, as they demand much more explanation.
Addr  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
----  -----------------------------------------------
0000: 47 43 52 2D 31 35 34 31 00 54 F8 1E .. .. .. ..

Offset         Description
$0000-0007     File signature (`GCR-1541')
$0008          `G64' version (presently only $00 defined)
$0009          Number of tracks in image (usually $54, decimal 84)
$000A-000B     Size of each stored track in bytes (usually 7928, or
$1EF8) in LO/HI format.

 An obvious question here is "why are there 84 tracks defined when
a
 normal `D64' disk only has 35 tracks?"  Well, by definition, this
image includes all half-tracks, so there are actually 42 tracks and 42
half tracks.  The 1541 stepper motor can access up to 42 tracks and
the
 in-between half-tracks.  Even though using more than 35 tracks is
not
 typical, it was important to define this format from the start
with what
 the 1541 is capable of doing, and not just what it
typically does.
 
 At first, the defined track size value of 7928
bytes may seem to be
 arbitrary, but it is not.  It is determined by
the fastest write speed
 possible (speed zone 0), coupled with the
average rotation speed of the
 disk (300 rpm).  After some math, the
answer that actually comes up is
 7692 bytes.  Why the discrepency
between the actual size of 7692 and the
 defined size of 7928? Simply
put, not all drives rotate at 300 rpm.
 Some can be faster or slower,
so a upper safety margin of +3% was built
 added, in case some disks
rotate slower and can write more data.  After
 applying this safety
factor, and some rounding-up, 7928 bytes per track
 was arrived at.

 Also note that this upper limit of 7928 bytes per track really only
applies to 1541 and compatible disks.  If this format were applied to
another disk type like the SFD1001, this value would be higher.
Below is a dump of the first section of a `G64' file, showing the
offsets
 to the data portion for each track and half-track entry.
Following that
 is a dump of the speed zone offsets.

Offset         Description
$015C-015F     Speed zone entry for track 1 ($03, in LO/HI  format, see
below for more)
$0160-0163     Speed zone entry for track 1.5 ($03)
...
$02A4-02A7     Speed zone entry for track 42 ($00)
$02A8-02AB     Speed zone entry for track 42.5 ($00)

 Starting here at $02AC is the first track entry (from above, it
is the
 first entry for track 1.0)
 
 The track offsets (from above)
require some explanation.  When one is
 set to all 0's, no track data
exists for this entry.  If there is a
 value, it is an absolute
reference into the file (starting from the
 beginning of the file).
From the track 1.0 entry we see it is set for
 $000002AC.  Going to
that file offset, here is what we see...

$02AC-02AD     Actual size of stored track (7692 or $1E0C, in LO/HI
format)
$02AE-02AE+$1E0CTrack data

 Following the track data is filler bytes.  In this case, there
are 368
 bytes of unused space.  This space can contain anything, but
for the
 sake of those wishing to compress these images for storage,
they should
 all be set to the same value.  In the sample I used,
these are all set
 to $FF.
 
 Below is a dump of the end of the
track 1.0 data area.  Note the actual
 track data ends at address
$20B9, with the rest of the block being
 unused, and set to $FF.

 The speed offset entries can be a little more complex. The 1541
has four
 speed zones defined, which means the drive can write data at
four
 distinct speeds.  On a normal 1541 disk, these zones are as
follows:
Track Range                          Speed Zone
1-17                                 3  (highest writing speed)
18-24                                2
25-30                                1
31 and up                            0 (lowest writing speed)

 Note that you can, through custom programming of the 1541, change
the
 speed zone of any track to something different (change the 3 to a
0) and
 write data differently.  From the dump of the speed offset
entries
 above, we see that all the entries are in the range of 0-3.
If any entry
 is less than 4, this is not considered a speed offset
but defines the
 whole track to be recorded at that one speed.
 
 In
the example I had, there were no offsets defined, so no speed zone
dump can be shown.  However, I can define what should be there.  You
will have a block of data, 1982 bytes long.  Each byte is encoded to
represent the speed of 4 bytes in the track offset area, and is broken
down as follows:
Speed entry $FF:  in binary %11111111
|'|'|'|'
| | | |
| | | +- 4'th byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
| | +--- 3'rd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
| +----- 2'nd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
+------- 1'st byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)

 It was very smart thinking to allow for two speed zone settings,
one in
 the offset block and another defining the speed on a per-byte
basis.  If
 you are working with a normal disk, where each track is
one constant
 speed, then you don't need the extra blocks of
information hanging
 around the image, wasting space.
 
 What may
not be obvious is the flexibility of this format to add tracks
 and
speed offset zones at will.  If a program decides to write a track
out with varying speeds, and no speed offset exist, a new block will
be
 created by appending it to the end of the image, and the offset
pointer
 for that track set to point to the new block.  If a track has
no offset
 yet, meaning it doesn't exist (like a half-track), and one
needs to be
 added, the same procedure applies.  The location of the
actual track or
 speed zone data is not important, meaning they do not
have to be in any
 particular order since they are all referenced by
the offsets at the
 beginning of the image.

18.1 VICE home page
===================


 You can find the latest news about VICE at the official VICE
 home
page:
http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/

 VICE has moved its source repository to public services provided
by
 SourceForge. You can find it at
http://sf.net/projects/vice-emu.

 We would like to thank the SourceForge staff for that help.
If you are going to report a bug, please check those pages _first_;
it is possible that the problem you encountered has already been
fixed with a newer version.
 
 Please, also have a look at the VICE
knowledge base at
http://vicekb.trikaliotis.net/


18.2 How to send feedback
=========================


 Before contacting us, have a look at the VICE knowledge base at
http://vicekb.trikaliotis.net/ if your question is answered
 there.
Keep in mind that we work on VICE in our spare-time, so the more
 time
we don't need to answer the same questions over and over again, the
more time we have to improve the emulation itself. On the other hand,
that does not mean that you should not contact us, especially if you
find bugs or have suggestions which might improve the emulation.
Bug reports, suggestions, support requests should be directed to the
SourceForge trackers at


* http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=223021.

 This way, you, the users, and we, the developers, can track what
has
 been reported and what has been already fixed. Ideally, also sent
the
 report to the mailing address of the Vice team at


* VICE Mailing List (<vice-devel@firenze.linux.it>) for all
general questions, bug reports, suggestions.

 You can also contact (some of) us on IRC, at #vice-dev on
freenode.
 
 It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports
about VICE, but
 please read these few notes before sending mail to
anybody in the
 team.


* Please put the word `VICE' _in all capitals_ in your subject
line (e.g., `VICE fails to run game XXX').  This helps mail
splitting and reduces chances that your message is
unintentionally
 deleted, forgotten or lost.

* Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you
use
 M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off
the
 "rich text" (HTML) feature.

* Please don't send _any_ binaries without asking first.

* Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a
bug
 or a problem you cannot solve:
* the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);

* the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable
from the
 VICE home page:
http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/);

* The VICE knowledge base (it is available on the Internet at
http://vicekb.trikaliotis.net/);

* the `comp.emulators.cbm' and `comp.sys.cbm' FAQs (*note FAQs
you should read::).


* When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible
and
 describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You
should also
 tell us what machine you are running on, what
operating system you are
 using as well as the version of it.

* Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to
your
 PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.
To transfer
 disks, you can use the Star Commander
(http://sta.c64.org/sc.html) on DOS, and OpenCBM
(http://www.trikaliotis.net/opencbm) on Windows and Linux.  And
no, you cannot read C64 disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

* Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
Internet.

* Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
really don't know.

* Please write in English.

 In any case, we would be _really_ glad to receive your comments
about VICE.  We cannot always answer all the email, but we surely read
all of it.
 
 Thanks!
 

18.3 How to contribute
======================


 If you want to make a major contribution, please _ask_ first.  It
has already happened a couple of times that somebody started working
at
 something that had already been done but not released to the
public yet,
 and we really do _not_ want anybody to waste time.
If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is
relative
 to the very latest version, and provide us with the
following:
* Make sure you are giving us a diff against the latest Subversion
trunk version of VICE. For instructions on accessing the
Subversion
 repository, first read
http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=223021 and
 get it with the
command:
`svn co https://vice-emu.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vice-emu/trunk vice-src'

* send a unified diff file against the trunk version of VICE (see
above
 bullet point) by using the command: `svn diff' inside of
the
 SVN workspace you checked out before.

* If you cannot use SVN for one or the other reason, send a unified
diff
 file containing all the changes you have made `diff -u';
please don't use plain `diff'), as it adds much work for us to
get
 it working;

* GNU-style `ChangeLog' entries with a description of the changes
you
 have made (look at the `ChangeLog's provided with the
original VICE
 sources for an example).

 This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother
and
 safer.
 
 People willing to port VICE to other platforms are
always welcome.
 But notice from experience it will take at least a
full year of
 continuous work to write a well working and stable
port.

18.4 Interesting newsgroups
===========================


 There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:


* `comp.emulators.cbm', discussing about emulators of Commodore
8-bit
 machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

* `comp.sys.cbm', discussing various topics regarding real
Commodore
 8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people
who actually use
 original Commodore equipment (so please don't
talk about emulation
 here).

* `comp.emulators.misc', discussing emulators in general.


18.5 FAQs you should read
=========================


 We recommend reading the `comp.emulators.cbm' and
 `comp.sys.cbm'
FAQs, which are posted regularly on the
 corresponding newsgroups and
are also available via FTP from
 ftp://rtfm.mit.edu.
