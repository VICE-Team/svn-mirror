Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  675
Mass Ave, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or,

b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with
such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

2 About VICE
************

VICE is the one and only "Versatile Commodore Emulator".  It provides
emulation of the Commodore C64, C64DTV, C128, VIC20, PET, PLUS4 and
CBM-II computers within a single package.  The emulators run as
separate programs, but have the same user interface, share the same
settings and support the same file formats.

*Important notice:* If you have no idea what a Commodore 8-bit
computer is, or have questions about how these machines are used, how
the file formats work or anything else that is not strictly related to
VICE, you should read the appropriate FAQs _first_, as that kind of
information is not available here.  *Note Contacts::. for information
about how to retrieve the FAQs.

All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with
emulation of all the opcodes (both documented and undocumented ones)
and accurate timing.  Unlike other emulators, VICE aims to be cycle
accurate; it tries to emulate chip timings as precisely as possible and
does so _efficiently_.

Please do _not_ expect the C64DTV, C128, PET, PLUS4 and CBM-II
emulators to be as good as the C64 or VIC20 one, as they are still
under construction.

_Notice:_ This documentation is written for the Unix release of VICE.

2.1 C64 emulator features
=========================

As of version 2.3, two C64 emulators are provided: `x64' (fast) and
`x64sc' (accurate).

The fast C64 emulator, called `x64', features a fairly complete
emulation of the VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and all video
modes are fully emulated.  The emulation has been fully cycle-accurate
since version 0.13.0.

The accurate C64 emulator, called `x64sc', features a cycle-based
and pixel-accurate VIC-II emulation. This requires a much faster machine
than the old `x64'.

A rather complete emulation of the SID sound chip is also provided.
All the basic features are implemented as well as most of the complex
ones including synchronisation, ring modulation and filters.  There are
three emulators of the SID chip available: first is the "standard" VICE
emulator, available since VICE 0.12; the second is Dag Lem's reSID
engine and the third one is reSID-fp. The reSID engines are a lot more
accurate than the standard engine, but they are also a lot slower, and
only suitable for faster machines.

Naturally, also both CIAs (or VIAs, in some cases) are fully emulated
and cycle accurate.

2.2 C64DTV emulator features
============================

The C64DTV emulator, called `x64dtv', features emulation of C64DTV
revisions 2 and 3. The emulator is under construction, but most of the
DTV specific features are already supported (with varying accuracy).

Video cache is disabled by default as it currently doesn't work with
some of C64DTV's new video modes. The new video modes have a simple
"fake" video cache implementation that may give incorrect results and
decreased performance.

2.3 C128 emulator features
==========================

The C128 emulator, called `x128', features a complete emulation of the
internal MMU ("Memory Management Unit"), 80 column VDC screen, fast IEC
bus emulation, 2 MHz mode, Z80 emulation plus all the features of the
C64 emulation.

2.4 VIC20 emulator features
===========================

The VIC20 emulates all the internal hardware, including the VIA chips.
The VIC-I video chip is fully emulated except NTSC interlace mode, so
most graphical effects will work correctly.

Sound support is implemented, but is still at an experimental stage.
If you think it could be improved and know how to do so, feel free to
contact us (*note Contacts::).

The VIC20 emulator now allows the use of the VIC1112 IEEE488
interface. You have to enable the hardware (by menu, resource, or
commandline option) and then load the IEEE488 ROM (see for example
`http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/vic20/ieee-488/325329-04.bin',
but you have to double the size to 4k for now).  The IEEE-488 code is
then started by `SYS45065'.

2.5 PET emulator features
=========================

The PET emulator emulates the 2001, 3032, 4032, 8032, 8096, 8296 and
SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) models, covering practically the whole
series.  The hardware is pretty much the same in each and that is why
one single program is enough to emulate all of them.  For more detailed
information about PET hardware please refer to the `PETdoc' file.

Both the 40 column and 80 column CRTC video chips are emulated (from
the 4032 onward), but a few of the features are not implemented yet
(numbers of rasterlines per char and lines per screen).  Fortunately,
they are not very important for average applications.

Sound is available for the PET as well, but like the VIC20's it is
still under construction.

The PET 8096 is basically a PET 8032 with a 64k extension board which
allows remapping the upper 32k with RAM.  You have to write to a special
register at `$fff0' to remap the memory.  The PET 8296 is a 8096 but
with a completely redesigned motherboard with 128k RAM in total.  Of
the additional 32k RAM you can use only some in blocks of 4k, but you
have to set jumpers on the motherboard for it.  VICE uses the command
line options `-petram9' and `-petramA' instead.  Also, the video
controller can handle a larger address range.  The PET 8x96 model
emulations run the Commodore LOS-96 operating system - basically an
improved BASIC 4 version with up to 32k for BASIC text and 32k for
variables.  See `PETdoc' for more information.

The SuperPET also is a PET 8032 with an expansion board.  It can map
4k at a time out of 64k into the `$9***' area.  Also it has an ACIA
6551 for RS232 communication.  The 6809 that is built into the SuperPET
is not emulated, though.

The PET computers came with three major ROM revisions, so-called
BASIC 1, 2 and 4, all of which are provided.  The PET 2001 uses the
version 1, the PET 3032 uses version 2, and the others use version 4.
The 2001 ROM is horribly broken with respect to IEEE488 (they shipped
it before they tested it with the floppy drive, so only tape worked.
Therefore the emulator patches the ROM to fix the IEEE488 routines.

As well as other low-level fixes the 2001 patch obtains the load
address for a program file from the first two bytes of the file.  This
allows the loading of both PET2001-saved files (that have $0400 as
their load address) and other PET files (that have $0401).  The PET2001
saves from $0400 and not from $0401 as other PETs do.

Moreover, the secondary addresses used are now `0' and `1' for load
and save, respectively, and not arbitrary unused secondary addresses.

To select which model to run, specify it on the command line with
the `-model MODEL' option, where `MODEL' can be one of a list of PET
model numbers, all described in *note PET model::

2.6 CBM-II emulator features
============================

The CBM-II emulator emulates several types of CBM-II models.  Those
models are known under different names in the USA and Europe.  In the
States they have been sold as `B128' and `B256', in Europe as `CBM
610', `CBM 620' (low-profile case) or `CBM 710' and `CBM 720'
(high-profile case with monitor). In addition to that now an
experimental C510 emulation is included. The C510 (also known as P500)
is the little brother of the C600/700 machines. It runs at roughly 1
MHz and, surprise, it has a VIC-II instead of the CRTC. Otherwise the
different line of computers are very similar.

These computers are prepared to take a coprocessor board with an
8088 or Z80 CPU.  Indeed there are models `CBM 630' and `CBM 730' that
supposedly had those processors.  However these models are not emulated.

The basic difference is the amount of RAM these machines have been
supplied with.  The `B128' and the `CBM *10' models had 128k RAM, the
others 256k. This implies some banking scheme, as the 6502 can only
address 64k.  And indeed those machines use a 6509, that can address 1
MByte of RAM.  It has 2 registers at addresses 0 and 1.  The indirect
bank register at address 1 determines the bank (0-15) where the opcodes
`LDA (zp),Y' and `STA (zp),Y' take the data from.  The exec bank
register at address 0 determines the bank where all other read and
write addresses take place.

The business line machines (C6xx/7xx) have the RAM in banks 1-2,
resp.  1-4. All available banks are used for BASIC, where program code
is separated from all variables, resp. from normal variables, strings
and arrays that are distributed over other banks. The C510 instead has
RAM in banks 0 and 1, and uses bank 1 for program and all variables.
Bank 0, though, can be accessed by the VIC-II to display graphics.

Many models have been expanded to more than the built-in memory.  In
fact some machines have been expanded to the full 1M.  Bank 15 is used
as system bank, with only little RAM, and lots of expansion cartridge
ROM area, the I/O and the kernal/basic ROMs.  Some models have been
modified to map RAM into the expansion ROM area.  Those modifications
can be emulated as well.

The different settings are described in *note CBM-II model::.

2.7 The keyboard emulation
==========================

There are two ways of emulating the keyboard in VICE.

The default way ("symbolic mapping") is to map every key combination
to the corresponding key combination on the real machine: for example,
if you press <*>, which is bound to `Shift-8' on a U.S. keyboard, in
the C64 emulator, the emulated machine will have just the _unshifted_
<*> key pressed (as <*> is unshifted on the C64 keyboard).  Likewise,
pressing <'> on the same U.S. keyboard without any shift key will cause
the combination `Shift-7' to be pressed in the emulated C64.  This way,
it becomes quite obvious what keys should be typed to obtain all the
symbols.

There is, however, one problem with symbolic mapping: some keys
really need to be mapped specially regardless.  The most important
examples being, in the VIC20, C64 and C128 emulators, that <CTRL> is
mapped to <Tab> and that the <Commodore> key is mapped to the left
<Control>). The <RUN/STOP> key is mapped to the <ESC> key on the PC
keyboard. The PET emulator, lacking the <Commodore> key but having an
<ESC> key, uses the left <Control> key as <RUN/STOP> and the <ESC> key
as <ESC> of course.

The second way ("positional mapping") is to map every key on the
"real" keyboard to the key which has the same position on the keyboard
of the emulated machine.  This way, no <Shift> key is forced by the
program (with the exception of the function keys <F2>, <F4>, <F6> and
<F8>, which require <Shift> on the Commodore keyboards), and the
keyboard is more comfortable to use in those programs (such as some
games) that require the keys to be in the correct positions.

*Warning:* unlike the real C64, VICE "presses" the <Shift> key
_together_ with the key to shift when the <Shift> must be forced.  In
most cases this should work fine, but some keyboard routines are quite
picky and tend not to recognize the shift key because of this.  For
instance, `F6' (which on the real C64 is obtained with `Shift + F5')
could be recognized as `F5'.  In that case, use the shift key manually
(i.e., type `Shift + F5' in the example).  Yes, we know this is a bug.

The `RESTORE' key is mapped to `Page Up' (or `Prev') by default.

2.8 The joystick emulation
==========================

Joysticks can be emulated both via the keyboard and via a real joystick
connected to the host machine (the latter only works on GNU/Linux
systems).

There are two keyboard layouts for joystick use, known as "numpad"
and "custom".

The "numpad" layout uses the numeric keypad keys, i.e., the numbers
<1>...<9> which emulate all the directions including the diagonal ones;
<0> emulates the fire button.

The "custom" layout uses the keys <w>, <e>, <r>, <s>, <d>, <f>, <x>,
<c>, <v> for the directions and <space> for the fire button instead.

2.9 The disk drive emulation
============================

All the emulators support up to 4 external disk drives as devices 8, 9,
10 and 11.  Each of these devices can emulate virtual Commodore 1541,
1541-II, 1571, 1581, 2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250 drives
in one of four ways:

* using disk images, i.e., files that contain a dump of all the
blocks contained in a real floppy disk (if you want more
information about what a disk image is, consult the
`comp.emulators.cbm' FAQ);

* accessing file system directories, thus giving you the use of files
without having to copy them to disk images; this also allows you to
read and write files in the `P00' format (again, consult the
`comp.emulators.cbm' FAQ for more info).

* accessing a real device connected to the host machine. As of VICE
1.11 it is possible to connect real drives like Commodore 1541 to
the printer port of the host using the XA1541 or XM1541 cable.
Currently this only works on Linux or Windows using the OpenCBM

* directly using the disk drive of the host. The 3.5" disk drive of
the host can be used to read or write Commodore 1581 formatted
disks.  Currently this raw drive access feature is only available
for Linux hosts.

When using disk images there are two available types of drive
emulation.  One of them the "virtual drive" emulation.  It does _not_
really emulate the serial line, but patches the kernal ROM (with the
so-called "kernal traps") so that serial line operations can be
emulated via C language routines.  This emulation is very fast, but
only allows use of standard DOS functions (and not even all of them).
For real device or raw drive access it is required to enable this type
of emulation.

The IEEE488 drives (2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250) do
not use kernal traps. Instead the IEEE488 interface lines are monitored
and the data is passed to the drive emulation. To use them on the C64,
you need to enable the IEEE488 interface emulation. Only if the IEEE488
emulation is enabled, those drives can be selected.

The other alternative is a "true drive" emulation.  The Commodore
disk drives are provided with their own CPU (a 6502 as the VIC20 and
the PETs) and their own RAM and ROM.  So, in order to more closely
emulate its features, a complete emulation of this hardware must be
provided and that is what the "hardware level" emulation does. When the
"hardware level" emulation is used, the kernal routines are remain
unpatched and the serial line is fully emulated.  The problem with this
emulation is that it needs a lot of processing power, mainly because
the emulator has to emulate two CPUs instead of one.

The PETs do not use a serial IEC bus to communicate with the floppy
drive but instead use the parallel IEEE488 bus.  This does _byte by
byte_ transfers, as opposed to the _bit by bit_ transfers of the C64
and VIC20, so making it feasible to emulate the parallel line
completely while emulating the drive at DOS level only.  The IEEE488
line interpreter maps the drives 8-11 (as described above) to the
IEEE488 disk units, and no kernal traps are needed.  The same emulation
of the Commodore IEEE488 bus interface is available for the C64 and the
VIC20. With IEEE488 drives you can have true 2031 emulation at unit #8,
and still have filesystem access at units #10 or #11, because
monitoring the IEEE488 lines does not interfere with the true drive
emulation.

The IEEE488 disk drives 3040, 4040, 8050 and 8250 are Dual Drive
Floppy Disks. This means that these drives handle two disks. To
Accomplish the emulation, only one disk can be emulated, namely unit
#8. The attached image, track display and LED display of unit #9 are
used for the second drive of the dual disk drives. On unix the unit
number display (8 or 9) in the emulation window changes to the drive
number display (0 or 1).

The Commodore 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250 disk drives are
so-called "old-style" disk drives. Their architecture includes not one,
but two processors of the 6502 type, namely a 6502 for the file
handling and communication with the PET (IP), and a 6504 (which is a
6502 with reduced address space) for the drive handling (FDC). Both
processors communicate over a shared memory area. The IP writes
commands to read/write blocks to this area and the FDC executes them.
To make the emulation feasible, the FDC processor is not emulated
cycle-exactly as a 6504, but simply by checking the commands and
executing them on the host. This provides a fast FDC emulation, but
disallows the sending the FDC processor commands to execute code.
Applications where this is necessary are believed to be rather seldom.
Only the format command uses this feature, but this is checked for.

The dual disk drive 2040 emulates one of the very first CBM disk
drives. This drive has DOS version 1. DOS1 uses an own disk type, that
is closely related to the 1541 disk image. Only on tracks 18-24 DOS1
disks have a sector more than 1541 disks. DOS1 disk images have the
extension .d67.

The dual disk drives 3040 and 4040 use the same logical disk format
as the VC1541 and the 2031. In fact, the 4040 was the first disk with
DOS version 2. The 3040 emulated here originally was the same as 2040,
only for the european 30xx PET series. As many of the original DOS1
disk drives were upgraded (a simple ROM upgrade!) to DOS2, I use the
3040 number for a DOS 2.0 disk drive, and 4040 for a revised DOS 2 disk
drive. It is, however, not yet clear whether the disks here are write
compatible to the 1541, as rumors exist that the write gap between
sectors is different. But read compatible they are. As VICE emulates
the FDC processor in C and not as 6504 emulation, this does not matter
in VICE.

The drives 1001, 8050 and 8250 do actually have the very same DOS
ROM. Only the code in the FDC is different, which is taken care of by
VICE. So for all three of those disk drives, only `dos1001' is needed.
The DOS version used is 2.7.

2.10 Supported file formats
===========================

VICE supports the most popular Commodore file formats:

* `X64' (preferred) or `D64' disk image files; Used by the 1541,
2031, 3040, 4040 drives.

* `G64' GCR-encoded 1541 disk image files;

* `D67' CBM2040 (DOS1) disk image format

* `D71' VC1571 disk image format

* `D81' VC1581 disk image format

* `D80' CBM8050 disk image format

* `D82' CBM8250/1001 disk image format

* `T64' tape image files (read-only);

* `P00' program files;


An utility (`c1541', *note c1541::) is provided to allow transfers
and conversions between these formats.

Notice that the use of the `X64' file format is depreciated now.

You can convert an `X64' file back into a `D64' file with the UNIX
`dd' command:

dd bs=64 skip=1 if=IMAGE.X64 of=IMAGE.D64

*Note File formats::. for a technical description of the supported
file formats.

2.11 Common problems
====================

This section tries to describe the most common known problems with VICE,
and how to resolve them.

2.11.1 Sound problems
---------------------

VICE should compile and run without major problems on many UNIX systems,
but there are some known issues related to the sound driver.  In fact,
the sound code is the least portable part of the emulator and has not
yet been thoroughly tested on all the supported platforms.

Linux, AIX and SGI systems should play sound without any problems; if
you are running Linux please use a 2.x kernel, as VICE needs some
features that were not implemented in older versions of the Linux sound
driver.

On the other hand, HP-UX and Solaris machines are known to cause
troubles.  If you think you can help debugging the code for these
systems, your help would be really appreciated.  We are having troubles
finding HP-UX and SUN consoles to work at...

Some problems have been reported with the proprietary version of the
Open Sound System for Linux.  With a Crystal sound card, sound output
was significantly delayed and, apparently, the allocated buffer size was
completely wrong.  This is not a VICE bug, but rather an OSS bug.

2.11.2 Shared memory problems
-----------------------------

If you cannot start VICE because you get errors about shared memory, try
to run it with the `+mitshm' command-line option (*note Video
options::).  This will completely disable usage of the MITSHM
extensions, that are normally used to speed up the emulation window
updates.  Of course, this will also result in a big loss in speed.

Reasons for this failure could be:

* IPC support has been disabled at the system level; some system
administrators disable this for security reasons.  If _you_ are the
system administrator, use a kernel that has IPC support compiled
in and enabled.

* You are attempting to run the emulator across the network (i.e.,
the emulator runs on one machine, and the output is displayed on
another machine that works as an X terminal) and for some reason
VICE does not recognize this fact.  In this case, you have found a
bug, so please report it to us.

If you want to avoid running the emulator with `+mitshm' every time,
run it once with `+mitshm' and then choose "Save settings" from the
right-button menu.

2.11.3 Printer problems
-----------------------

VICE supports the emulation of a printer either on the userport or as
IEC device 4. Unfortunately the Commodore IEC routines do not send all
commands to the IEC bus. For example an `OPEN 1,4' is not seen on the
IEC bus. Also a `CLOSE 1' after that is not seen. VICE can see from
printing that there was an `OPEN', but it cannot see when the close
was. Also a "finish print job" cannot be seen on the userport device.
To flush the printer buffer (write to `print.dump' or to the printer)
now a menu entry can be used. Disabling and re-enabling the printer
should work as well.

The printing services have not been extensively tested but apart
from the problem mentioned above it should work fine now.

2.11.4 PET keyboard problems
----------------------------

If you find that the German keyboard mapping (plus German charset) does
not print uppercase umlauts, then you are right.  The umlauts replace
the [, and ] characters in the charset. The keys that make these
characters do not have a different entry in the PET editor ROM tables
when shifted.  Thus it is not possible to get the uppercase umlauts in
the editor.  Nevertheless other programs are reported to change the
keyboard mapping table and thus allow the use of the shifted
(uppercase) umlauts.

Anyway, the VICE keyboard mappings are far from being perfect and we
are open to any suggestions.

3 Invoking the emulators
************************

The names of the available emulators are:

* `x64', the fast C64 emulator

* `x64sc', the accurate C64 emulator

* `x64dtv', the C64DTV emulator

* `x128', the C128 emulator

* `xvic', the VIC20 emulator

* `xpet', the PET emulator

* `xplus4', the PLUS4 emulator

* `xcbm2', the CBM-II emulator


You can run each of them by simply typing the name from a shell.  If
you want to run them from another application (e.g., a window manager or
some other sort of program launcher) you should always run them from a
terminal window such as `xterm' or `rxvt' since VICE provides a lot of
debugging information that is sent to the terminal and has built-in
monitor that also appears there.  For example, you could do

xterm -e x64

3.1 Command-line options used during initialization
===================================================

There are several options you can specify on the command line.  Some of
them are used to specify emulation settings and will be described in
detail later (*note Settings and resources:: for a complete list).  The
remaining options are used only to give usage information or to
initialize the emulator in some way:

`-help'
`-?'
List all the available command-line options and their meaning.

`-default'
Set default resources (*note Settings and resources::).  This will
override all the settings specified before, but not the settings
specified afterwards on the command line.

`-config <filename>'
Specify config file

`-logfile <name>'
Specify log file name

`-verbose'
Enable verbose log output.

`-keybuf <string>'
Put the specified string into the keyboard buffer.

`-console'
Console mode (for music playback)

`-chdir <directory>'
Change the working directory.

`-autostart IMAGE'
Autostart `IMAGE' (*note Command-line autostart::).

`-autoload <name>'
Attach and autoload tape/disk image <name>

`-basicload'
On autostart, load to BASIC start (without ',1')

`+basicload'
On autostart, load with ',1'

`-autostartwithcolon'
On autostart, use the 'RUN' command with a colon, i.e., 'RUN:'

`+autostartwithcolon'
On autostart, do not use the 'RUN' command with a colon; i.e.,
'RUN'

`-autostart-handle-tde'
`+autostart-handle-tde'
Handle/Do not handle True Drive Emulation on autostart

`+autostart-warp'
Enable/Disable warp mode during autostart

`-autostartprgmode'
Set autostart mode for PRG files

`-autostartprgdiskimage'
Set disk image for autostart of PRG files

`-1 NAME'
Attach `NAME' as a tape image file.

`-8 NAME'
`-9 NAME'
`-10 NAME'
`-11 NAME'
Attach `NAME' as a disk image to device 8, 9, 10 or 11.

`-attach8ro'
`-attach9ro'
`-attach10ro'
`-attach11ro'
Attach disk image for drive #8-11 read only

`-attach8rw'
`-attach9rw'
`-attach10rw'
`-attach11rw'
Attach disk image for drive #8-11 read write (if possible)


3.2 Autostarting programs from the command-line
===============================================

It is possible to let the emulator "autostart" a disk or tape image
file, by simply specifying its name as the _last_ argument on the
command line, for example

x64 lovelygame.x64.gz

will start the C64 emulator, attaching `lovelygame.x64.gz' as a disk
image and running the first program on it.  You can also specify the
name of the program on the fisk image by appending a colon (`:') the
name itself to the argument; for example

x64 "lovelygame.x64.gz:run me"

will run the program named `run me' on `lovelygame.x64.gz' instead
of the first one.

Using the command-line option `-autostart' is equivalent; so the same
result can be obtained with

x64 -autostart "lovelygame.x64.gz:run me"

If you specify a raw CBM or P00 file, the emulator will setup the
file system based drive emulation so that it is enabled and accesses the
directory containing the file first.  This is a very convenient way to
start multi-file programs stored in file system directories and not
requiring "true" drive emulation.

*Note Disk and tape images::. for more information about images and
autostart.

4 System files
**************

In order to work properly, the emulators need to load a few system
files:

* the "system ROMs", raw binary files containing copies of the
original ROMs of the machine you are emulating;

* the "keyboard maps", text files describing the keyboard layout;

* the "palette files", text files describing the colors of the
machine you are emulating.

* the "romset files", text files describing the different ROMs to
load.


The place where they will be searched for depends on the value of the
`Directory' resource, which is a colon (`:')-separated search path
list, like the UNIX `PATH' environment variable.  The default value is

PREFIX/lib/vice/EMU:$HOME/.vice/EMU:BOOTPATH/EMU

Where `PREFIX' is the installation prefix (usually `/usr/local'),
`EMU' is the name of the emulated machine (`C64', `C128', `PET',
`CBM-II' or `VIC20') and `BOOTPATH' is the directory where the
executable resides.  The disk drive ROMs are looked for in a directory
with `EMU' set to `DRIVES'. `$HOME' is the user's home directory.

For example, if you have the C64 emulator installed in

/usr/local/bin/x64

then the value will be

/usr/local/lib/vice/C64:$HOME/.vice/C64:/usr/local/bin/C64

And system files will be searched for under the following
directories, in the specified order:

1. `/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64'

2. `$HOME/.vice/C64'

3. `/usr/local/bin/C64'

System files can still be installed in a different directory if you
specify a complete path instead of just a file name.  For example, if
you specify `./kernal' as the kernal image name, the kernal image will
be loaded from the current directory.  This can be done by using
command-line options or by modifying resource values (*note Resource
files::).

4.1 ROM files
=============

Every emulator requires its own ROM set.  For the VIC20 and the C64, the
ROM set consists of the following files:

* `kernal',  the Kernal ROM (8 KBytes)

* `basic', the Basic ROM (8 KBytes)

* `chargen', the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)


The C128 needs the following files:

* `kernal', the Kernal ROM (8 Kbytes)

* `basic', the Basic + Editor ROM (32 Kbytes)

* `chargen', the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)


The C128, VIC20 and C64 emulators also need the following DOS ROMs
for the hardware-level emulation of the 1541, 1571, 1581, 2000 and 4000
disk drives:

* `dos1541', the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

* `dos1541II', the 1541-II drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

* `dos1571', the 1571 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

* `dos1581', the 1581 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

* `dos2000', the 2000 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

* `dos4000', the 4000 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)


In addition to those all emulators can handle a parallel IEEE488
interface (the C64 and C128 via `$df**' extension, the VIC20 via
VIC1112 emulation) so they also need the DOS ROM for the IEEE disk
drives:

* `dos2031', the 2031 drive ROM (16 Kbytes) (DOS 2.6, Commodore ROM
images 901484-03 and 901484-05)

* `dos2040', the 2040 drive ROM (8 Kbytes) (DOS 1, Commodore ROM
images 901468-06, 901468-07)

* `dos3040', the 3040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes) (DOS 2, Commodore ROM
images 901468-11, 901468-12 and 901468-13)

* `dos4040', the 4040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes) (DOS 2, Commodore ROM
images 901468-14, 901468-15 and 901468-16)

* `dos1001', the 1001/8050/8250 drive ROM (16 Kbytes) (DOS 2.7,
Commodore ROM images 901887-01 and 901888-01)


Note that there are other DOS images on the internet. The DOS 2.5
images might be used with the 8050, but it cannot handle the double
sided drives of the 1001 and 8250 and it is not supported by VICE.

The PET emulator uses an expanded setup, because there are three
major versions of the Basic and the Kernal, and many versions of the
Editor ROM. In addition there are cartridge ROM sockets.

The Kernal files contain the memory from range $F000-$FFFF, the Basic
ROMs either the range $C000-$DFFF or $B000-$DFFF.  To handle the
different screen sizes and keyboards, different so-called "editor-ROMs"
for the memory range $E000-$E800 are provided.  The PET ROMs have the
following names:

* `kernal1', the PET2001 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes) (Commodore ROM images
901447-06 and 901447-07)

* `kernal2', the PET3032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes) (Commodore ROM image
901465-03)

* `kernal4', the PET4032/8032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes) (Commodore ROM
image 901465-22)

* `basic1', the PET2001 Basic 1 ROM (8 KBytes) (Commodore ROM images
901447-09, 901447-02, 901447-03, 901447-04.bin.  The -09 ROM is
the revised -01 ROM)

* `basic2', the PET3032 Basic 2 ROM (8 KBytes) (Commodore ROM images
901465-01 and 901465-01)

* `basic4', the PET4032/8032 Basic 4 ROM (12 KBytes) (Commodore ROM
images 901465-23, 901465-20 and 901465-21.  The -23 ROM is a
revised -19 ROM)

* `edit1g', the PET2001 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901447-05)

* `edit2b', the PET3032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-01)

* `edit2g', the PET3032 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901447-24)

* `edit4g40', the PET4032 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901498-01)

* `edit4b40', the PET4032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-02)

* `edit4b80', the PET8032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-04-?)

*   * `chargen', the character generator ROM (2k).  It has two sets
with 128 chars each.  The second (inverted) half of each set is
computed from the first half by inverting it.  This is a PET
hardware feature.  (Commodore ROM image 901447-10)

* `chargen.de', the character generator ROM (2k). This version is a
patched German charset, with the characters [,  and ] replaced by
umlauts.  It has been provided by U. Guettich and he reports that
it is supported by some programs.

The PETs also have sockets for extension ROMs for the addresses
$9000-$9FFF, $A000-$AFFF and $B000-$BFFF (the last one for PET2001 and
PET3032 only).  You can specify ROM image files for those extensions
command line options `-petrom9', `-petromA' and `-petromB' resp.

An alternative would be to specify a long kernal ROM with the
`-kernal' option that includes the extension ROM areas.

Also, you can specify replacements for the basic ROM at $B000-$DFFF
with the `-petromBasic' option and for the editor ROM at $E000-$E7FF
with the `-petromEditor' option.

The CBM-II emulator again uses another setup.  For those models the
kernal used is the same for all.  However, for different amounts of
memory exist different versions of the BASIC ROMs.  The 128k RAM version
(C610, C710, B128) uses one bank of 64k for the BASIC text and another
one for all the variables.  The 256k RAM version uses one bank for text,
one for variables, one for arrays and one for strings.

Also the character generator ROMs have a format different from the
above.  The other character ROMs have 8 bytes of pixel data per
character.  Those ROMs have 16 bytes per character instead.  The C6x0
only uses the first 8 of it, but the C7x0 uses 14 lines per character
and needs those increased ROMs.  Both ROMs hold, like the PET, two
character sets with 128 characters each.  Again the second half of the
full (256 char) character set is computed by inverting.

* `kernal', the KERNAL (8k) for the business machines (6xx/7xx)

* `kernal.500', the KERNAL (8k) for the personal machine (510)
(901234-02)

* `basic.128', the CBM-II 128k BASIC (16k)

* `basic.256', CBM-II 256k BASIC (16k)

* `basic.500', C510 BASIC (16k) (901236-02 + 901235-02)

* `chargen.500', character generator ROM for the C5x0 (4k)
(901225-01)

* `chargen.600', character generator ROM for the C6x0 (4k)

* `chargen.700', character generator ROM for the C7x0 (4k)


4.2 Keymap files
================

"Keymap files" are used to define the keyboard layout, defining which
key (or combination of keys) must be mapped to each keysym.

In other words, the keyboard emulation works like this: whenever the
user presses or releases a key while the emulation window has the input
focus, the emulator receives an X-Window event with a value that
identifies that key.  That value is called a "keysym" and is unique to
that key.  The emulator then looks up that keysym in an internal table
that tells it which key(s) to press or release on the emulated keyboard.

This table is described by the keymap file, which is made up of lines
like the following:

KEYSYM ROW COLUMN SHIFTFLAG

Where:

* `KEYSYM' is a string identifying the keysym: you can use the `xev'
utility (shipped with the X Window system) to see what keysym is
bound to any key;

* `ROW' and `COLUMN' identify the key on the emulated keyboard;

* `SHIFTFLAG' can have one of the following values:

* `0': the key is never shifted;

* `1': the key is shifted;

* `2': the key is the left shift;

* `4': the key is the right shift;

* `8': the key can be (optionally) shifted by the user.



The `SHIFTFLAG' is useful if you want certain keys to be
"artificially" shifted by the emulator, and not by the user.  For
example, <F2> is shifted on the C64 keyboard, but you might want it to
be mapped to the unshifted <F2> key on the PC keyboard.  To do so, you
just have to use a line like the following:

F2 0 4 1

where `0' and `4' identify the key (row 0, column 4 on the keyboard
matrix), and `1' specifies that every time the user presses <F2> the
shift key on the C64 keyboard must be pressed.

There are also some special commands you can put into the keyboard
file; they are recognized because they start with an exclamation mark:

* `!CLEAR' clears the currently loaded keyboard map; it is necessary
to put this at the beginning of the file if you want the keymap
file to override all of the current internal settings;

* `!LSHIFT', `!RSHIFT', followed by a row and a column value,
specify where the left and right shift keys are located on the
emulated keyboard; for example, C64 default keymaps will specify

!LSHIFT 1 7
!RSHIFT 6 4


Any line starting with the `#' sign, instead, is completely ignored.
This is useful for adding comments within the keymap file.

VICE keymap files have the `.vkm' default extension, and every
emulator comes with a default positional mapping and a default symbolic
mapping.

4.3 Palette files
=================

"Palette files" are used to specify the colors used in the emulators.
They are made up of lines like the following:

RED GREEN BLUE DITHER

where `RED', `GREEN' and `BLUE' are hexadecimal values ranging from
0 to FF and specifying the amount of red, green and blue you want for
each color and `DITHER' is a 4-bit hexadecimal number specifying the
pattern you want when rendering on a B/W display.

You have to include as many lines as the number of colors the
emulated machine has, and the order of the lines must respect the one
used in the machine (so the N'th line must contain the specifications
for color N - 1 in the emulated machine).

Lines starting with the `#' sign are completely ignored.  This is
useful for adding comments (such as color names) within the palette
file.

For example, the default PET palette file (which has only two
colors, 0 for background and 1 for foreground), looks like the
following:

#
# VICE Palette file
#
# Syntax:
# Red Green Blue Dither
#

# Background
00 00 00 0

# Foreground
00 FF 00 F

4.4 Romset files
================

The Romset files are not used by default on all emulators.  You might
have recognized that the names of the ROM images are saved in
resources. Loading a Romset file now just means a `shortcut' to
changing all the resources with ROM image names and reloading the ROMs.

The PET and CBM-II emulators use this feature to change between the
different ROM versions available for those machines. E.g. the Romset
file for the PET 2001 is

As you can see, the file even uses the same syntax as the resource
file, it is just a bit stripped down.

5 Basic operation
*****************

This section describes the basic things you can do once the emulator
has been fired up.

5.1 The emulation window
========================

When the emulator is run, the screen of the emulated machine is
displayed in a standard X Window which we will call the "emulation
window".  This window will be updated in real time, displaying the same
contents that a real monitor or TV set would.

Below the emulation window there is an area which is used to display
information about the state of the emulator; we will call this area the
"status bar".

On the extreme left of the status bar, there is a "performance
meter".  This displays the current relative speed of the emulator (as a
percentage) and the update frequency (in frames per second).  All the
machines emulated are PAL, so the update frequency will be 50 frames
per second if your system is fast enough to allow emulation at the
speed of the real machine.

On the extreme right of the status bar, there is a "drive status
indicator".  This is only visible if the hardware-level ("True") 1541
emulation is turned on.  In that case, the drive status indicator will
contain a rectangle emulating the drive LED and will display the current
track position of the drive's read/write head.

5.2 Using the menus
===================

It is possible to execute some commands and change emulation parameters
while the emulator is running: when the pointer is over the emulation
window, two menus are available by pressing either the left or right
mouse buttons.  The left mouse button will open the "command menu" from
which several emulation-related commands can be executed; the right
mouse button will open the "settings menu" from which emulation
parameters can be changed.  The basic difference between the command and
the settings menu is that, while commands have only effect on the
current session, settings can be saved and later used with the "Save
settings" and "Load settings" right-button menu items, respectively.
"Restore default settings" restores the factory defaults.  *Note
Settings and resources::. for more information about how settings work
in VICE.

Sometimes commands can be reached via "shortcuts" or "hotkeys",
i.e., it is possible to execute them by pressing a sequence of keys
instead of going through the menu with the mouse.  Where shortcuts
exist, they are displayed in parentheses at the right edge of the menu
item.  In VICE, all shortcuts must begin with the <Meta> or <Alt> key.
So, for example, to attach a disk image to drive #8 (the corresponding
menu item displays "M-8"), you have to press the <Meta> (or <Alt>) and
then <8>.

Note that no other key presses are passed on to the emulated machine
while either <Meta> or <Alt> are held down.

5.3 Getting help
================

At any time, if you get stuck or do not remember how to perform a
certain action, you can use the "Browse manuals" command (left button
menu).  This will popup a browser and open the HTML version of this
documentation.  Notice that this requires VICE to be properly (and
fully) installed with a `make install'.

The browser can be specified via the `HTMLBrowserCommand' string
resource (*note Settings and resources:: for information about
resources).  Every `%s' in the string will be replaced with a URL to
the VICE HTML pages.

5.4 Using the file selector
===========================

In those situations where it is necessary to specify a file name, all
of the VICE emulators will pop up a file selector window allowing you
to select or specify a file interactively.

To the left of the file selector, there is a list of ancestor
directories: by clicking on them, you can ascend the directory tree.  To
the right, there is a list of the files in the current directory; files
can be selected by clicking on them.  If you click on a directory, that
directory becomes the current one; if you click on an ordinary file, it
becomes the active selection.

At the top, there is a "directory box", with the complete path of
the current directory, and a "file name box", with the name of the
currently selected file.  At the bottom there are two buttons: "OK"
confirms the selected file and "Cancel" abandons the file selector
without cancelling the operation.

It is also possible to specify what files you want to show in the
file selector by writing an appropriate shell-like pattern in the
directory box; e.g., `~/*.[dx]64' will only show files in the home
directory whose name ends with either `.d64' or with `.x64'.

5.5 Using disk and tape images
==============================

The emulator is able to emulate disk drives and (read-only) tape
recorders if provided with suitable "disk images" or "tape images".  An
"image" is a raw dump of the contents of the media, and must be
"attached" before the emulator can use it.  "Attaching" a disk or tape
image is like "virtually" inserting a diskette or a cassette into the
disk drive or the tape recorder: once an image is attached, the
emulator is able to use it as a storage media.

There are five commands (in the left button menu) that deal with disk
and tape images:

* Attach Disk Image

* Detach Disk Image

* Attach Tape Image

* Detach Tape Image

* Smart-attach a file


The first four commands are used to insert and remove the virtual
disks and cassettes from the respective units.  On the other hand, the
last commands tries to guess the type of the image you are attaching
from its name and size, and attaches it to the most reasonable device.

Supported formats are `D64' and `X64' for disk images (devices 8, 9
and 10) and `T64' for tape images.  Notice that `T64' support is
_read-only_, and that the cassette is automatically rewound when you
reach its end.

Another important feature is that raw Commodore BASIC binary files
and .P00 files can be attached as tapes.  As you can autostart a tape
image when it is attached (*note Autostart::), this allows you to
autostart these particular files as well.

You can attach a disk for which you do not have write permissions:
when this happens, the 1541 emulator will emulate a write-protected
disk.  This is also useful if you want to prevent certain disk images
from being written to; in the latter case, just remove the write
permission for that file, e.g., by doing a `chmod a-w'.

5.5.1 Previewing the image contents
-----------------------------------

It is possible to examine the directory of a disk or tape image before
attaching it.  Just press the "Contents" button in the file selector
window and a new window will pop up with the contents of the selected
image.

Notice that this function automatically translates the directory from
PETSCII to ASCII; but, due to differences in the two encodings, it is
not always possible to translate all the characters, so you might get
funny results when "weird" characters such as the semi-graphical ones
are being used.

5.5.2 "Autostarting" an image
-----------------------------

If you want to reset the machine and run the first program on a certain
image without typing any commands at the Commodore BASIC prompt, you can
use the "Autostart" button in the file selector window after selecting
a proper disk or tape image file.

Notice that, if true drive emulation is turned on, it will be turned
off before running the program and then turned on again after it has
been loaded.  This way, you get the maximum possible speed while
loading the file, but you do not lose compatibility once the program
itself is running.

This method is not completely safe, because some autostarting methods
might cause the true drive emulation not to be turned on again.  In such
cases, the best thing to do is to disable kernal traps (which will cause
true drive emulation to be always kept turned on), or to manually load
the program with true drive emulation turned on.

5.5.3 Using compressed files
----------------------------

It is also possible to attach disk or tape images that have been
compressed through various algorithms; compression formats are
identified from the file extension.  The following formats are supported
(the expected file name extension is in parenthesis):

* GNU Zip (`.gz' or `.z');

* BZip version 2 (`.bz2');

* PkZip (`.zip');

* GNU Zipped TAR archives (`.tar.gz', `.tgz');

* Zoo (`.zoo').

PkZip, `tar.gz', `lha' and `zoo' support is _read-only_ and always
uses the _first_ `T64' or `D64' file in the archive.  So archives
containing multiple files will always be handled as if they contain
only a single file.

Windows and MSDOS don't contain the needful programs to handle
compressed archives. Get gzip and unzip for Windows at
ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/WIN32 and for MSDOS at
ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/MSDOS. Don't use pkunzip for
MSDOS, it doesn't work. The programs to use BZip2 archives may be found
at http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2.  Just put the programs
(unzip.exe, gzip.exe, bzip2.exe) into a directory of your search path
(e.g. C:DOS or C:WINDOWSCOMMAND; have a look at the PATH variable).

5.5.4 Using Zipcode and Lynx images
-----------------------------------

Since version 0.15, the VICE emulators have been able to attach disks
packed with Zipcode or Lynx directly, removing the need to manually
convert them into `D64' or `X64' files with `c1541'.  This is achieved
by automatically invoking `c1541', letting it decode the file into a
temporary image and attaching the resulting temporary image read-only.
For this to work, the directory containing `c1541' must be in your
`PATH'.

This uses the `-unlynx' and `-zcreate' options of `c1541' (*note
c1541 commands and options::); these commands are not very reliable
yet, and could fail with certain kinds of Lynx and Zipcode images (for
example, they cannot deal with `DEL' files properly).  So please use
them with caution.

Lynx files usually come as `.lnx' files which are unpacked into
single disk images.  On the other hand, Zipcode files do not have a
particular extension (although `.z64' is sometimes used), and represent
a disk by means of component files, named as follows:

* `1!NAME'

* `2!NAME'

* `3!NAME'

* `4!NAME'

If you attach as a disk image (or smart-attach) any one of these
files, the emulator will simply pick up the other three (by examining
the name) and then build a disk image using all four.

5.6 Resetting the machine
=========================

You can reset the emulated machine at any time by using the "Reset"
command from the command menu.  There are two types of reset:

* "soft reset", which simply resets the CPU and all the other chips;

* "hard reset", which also clears up the contents of RAM.

A "soft reset" is the same as a hardware reset achieved by pulling
the RESET line down; a "hard reset" is more like a power on/power off
sequence in that it makes sure the whole RAM is cleared.

It is possible that a soft reset may not be enough to take the
machine to the OS initialization sequence: in such cases, you will have
to do a hard reset instead.

This is especially the case for the CBM-II emulators.  Those machines
examine a memory location and if they find a certain "magic" value they
only do what you know from the C64 as `Run/Stop-Restore'.  Therefore,
to really reset a CBM-II use hard reset.

6 Settings and resources
************************

In the VICE emulators, all the settings are stored in entities known as
called "resources".  Each resource has a name and a value which may be
either an integer or a string.  Integer values are often used as
boolean values with the usual convention of using zero for "false" and
any other value for "true".

Resource values can be changed via the right-button menu (the
"settings" menu), via command-line options or via the "resource file".

The "resource file" is a human-readable file containing resource
values: it is called `vicerc' and is stored in the directory `.vice/'
in the user's home directory.  It is possible to dump the current
values of the resources into that file or load the values stored into
that file as the current values, at any time.  This is achieved with
the "Save settings" and "Load settings" right menu items.  A third menu
item, "Restore Default Settings", can be used to reset all the values
to the factory defaults.

A special resource, `SaveResourcesOnExit', if set to a non zero
value, causes the emulator to ask you if you want to save the current
(changed) settings before exiting, and can be toggled with the "Save
settings on exit" command from the right-button menu.

Notice that not all the resources can be changed from the menus;
some of them can only be changed by manually modifying the resource
file or by using command-line options.

6.1 Format of resource files
============================

A resource file is made up of several sections; sections have the
purpose of separating the resources of a certain emulator from the ones
of the other emulators.  A section starts with the name of an emulator
in brackets (e.g., `[C64]') and ends when another section starts or
when the file ends.

Every line in a section has the following format:

RESOURCE=VALUE

where `RESOURCE' is the name of a resource and `VALUE' is its
assigned value.  Resource names are case-sensitive and resource values
are either strings or integers.  Strings must start and end with a
double quote character (`"'), while integers must be given in decimal
notation.

Here is an example of a stripped-down `.vice/vicerc' file:

[VIC20]
HTMLBrowserCommand="netscape %s"
SaveResourcesOnExit=0
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/vic20p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1
[C64]
HTMLBrowserCommand="netscape %s"
SaveResourcesOnExit=1
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/c64p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1

Notice that, when resource values are saved with "Save settings", the
emulator only modifies its own section, leaving the others unchanged.

6.2 Using command-line options to change resources
==================================================

Resources can also be changed via command-line options.

Command-line options always override the defaults from
`.vice/vicerc', and their assignments last for the whole session.  So,
if you specify a certain command-line option that changes a certain
resource from its default value and then use "Save Settings", the value
specified with the command-line option will be saved back to the
resource file.

Command-line options can begin with with a minus sign (`-') or with
a plus sign (`+').  Options beginning with a minus sign may require an
additional parameter, while the ones beginning with the plus sign never
require one.

Moreover, options beginning with a plus sign always have a
counterpart with the same name, but with a minus sign; in that case,
the option beginning with a minus sign is used to _enable_ a certain
feature, while the one beginning with a plus sign is used to _disable_
the same feature (this is an X11 convention).  For example, `-mitshm'
enables support of MITSHM, while `+mitshm' disables it.

6.3 Performance settings
========================

It is possible to control the emulation speed by using the "Maximum
speed" menu item in the right-button menu.  The default setting is
`100', which causes the emulation to never run faster than the real
machine.  A higher value allows the emulator to run faster, a lower one
may force it to run slower.  The setting "No limit" means to run as
fast as possible, without limiting speed.

It is also possible to control the emulator's rate of frame update
using the "Refresh rate" setting; the value ranges from "1/1" (update
1/1 of the frames of the real machine, that is 50 frames per second) to
"1/10" (update 1 every 10 frames) and can be changed via the "Refresh
Rate" submenu.  The "Auto" setting means to dynamically adapt the
refresh rate to the current speed of the host machine, making sure the
maximum speed specified by the via "Maxium speed" is always reached if
possible.  In any case, the refresh rate will never be worse than 1/10
if this option is specified.

Note that you cannot simultaneously specify "Auto" as the refresh
rate and "No limit" as the maximum speed..

Moreover, a special "warp speed" mode is provided and can be toggled
with the "Enable Warp Mode" menu item.  If this mode is enabled, it
will cause the emulator to disable any speed limit, turn sound emulation
off and use a 1/10 refresh rate, so that it will run at the maximum
possible speed.

6.3.1 Performance resources
---------------------------

`Speed'
Integer specifying the maximum relative speed, as a percentage.
`0' stands for "no limit".

`RefreshRate'
Integer specifying the refresh rate; a value of `n' specifies a
refresh rate of 1/`n'.  A value of `0' enables automatic frame
skipping.

`WarpMode'
Booolean specifying whether "warp mode" is turned on or not.


6.3.2 Performance command-line options
--------------------------------------

`-speed VALUE'
Specifies the maximum speed as a percentage.  `0' stands for "no
limit".  (Same as setting the `Speed' resource.)

`-refresh VALUE'
Specifies refresh rate; a value of `n' specifies a refresh rate of
1/`n'.  A value of `0' enables automatic frame skipping.  (Same as
setting the `RefreshRate' resource.)

`-warp'
`+warp'
Enables/disables warp mode (`WarpMode=1', `WarpMode=0').


6.4 Video settings
==================

The following right-button menu items control the video output.  On
emulators that include two video chips (like `x128') all options but
XSync exist twice, once for each chip.  XSync is shared between the
video chips.

* "Video Cache" enables a video cache that can speed up the emulation
when little graphics activity is going on; it is especially useful
when you run the emulator on a networked X terminal as it can
reduce the network bandwidth required.  However, this setting can
actually make the emulator slower when there is little graphics
activity and the amount of work needed to maintain the cache is
greater than the amount of work that would be wasted by not using
it (if any).

* "Double Size" toggles "double-size mode", which makes the
emulation window twice as big.  When emulating a 80-column PET,
only the height is doubled, so that the aspect ratio is closer to
that of the real thing.

* "Double Scan" toggles "double-scan mode", which causes the
emulator to draw only odd lines when running in double-size mode
(this saves some CPU time and also makes the emulation window look
more like an old monitor).

* `Use XSync()" causes the emulator to call the X11 function
`XSync()' before updating the emulation window: this might be
necessary on low-end systems to prevent it from consuming so many
system resources that it becomes impossible for the user to
interact with it.


6.4.1 Video resources
---------------------

The following resources affect the screen emulation. The prefix of some
of the resources and commandline options denote the video chip the
values apply to.

`UseXSync'
Boolean specifying whether `XSync()' is called after updating the
emulation window.

`MITSHM'
Integer specifying whether VICE should try to use the shared memory
extensions (MITSHM) when starting up.  The shared memory
extensions make things a lot faster but might not be available on
your system.  You will not be able to use these extensions if you
are sitting at an X terminal while running the emulator on a
remote machine across a network.  Valid values are: 0 = do not use
MITSHM, 1 = do use MITSHM, -1 = try to autodetect availability on
startup (default).  The last is a simple test if the emulator runs
across a network and if so disables MITSHM (If you have problems
with this test please report it).

`PrivateColormap'
Boolean specifying whether VICE should install a private colormap
at startup.  This makes sense for 8-bit displays that could run
out of colors if other color-hungry applications are running at
the same time.

`DisplayDepth'
Integer specifying the depth of the host display.  The value `0'
(the default) causes the emulator to autodetect it.


6.4.2 Video command-line options
--------------------------------

`-xsync'
`+xsync'
Enable/disable usage of `XSync()' when updating the emulation
window (`UseXSync=1', `UseXSync=0').

`-mitshm'
`+mitshm'
Enable/disable usage of the MITSHM extensions (`MITSHM=1',
`MITSHM=0').

`-install'
`+install'
Enable/disable installation of a private colormap
(`PrivateColormap=1', `PrivateColormap=0').

`-displaydepth DEPTH'
Specify the display depth (`DisplayDepth').

`-fullscreen'
`+fullscreen'
Enable/disable fullscreen mode


6.5 Keyboard settings
=====================

It is possible to specify whether the "positional" or "symbolic"
keyboard mapping should be used with the "Keyboard mapping type"
submenu (*note Keyboard emulation:: for an explanation of positional
and symbolic mappings).

The keyboard settings submenu also allows you to:

* Load custom-made positional and symbolic keymap files ("Set
symbolic keymap file" and "Set positional keymap file").

* Dump the current keymap to a user-defined keymap file ("Dump to
keymap file").

6.5.1 Keyboard resources
------------------------

`KeymapIndex'
Integer identifying which keymap is being used; `0' indicates
symbolic mapping, `1' positional mapping.  For the PET the even
values represent symbolic mapping, odd positional.  Then add `0'
for UK business keyboard or `2' for graphics keyboard.

`KeymapSymFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic
mapping (*note Keyboard emulation::, all but PET and CBM-II).

`KeymapPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the positional
mapping (*note Keyboard emulation::, all but PET and CBM-II).

`KeymapBusinessUKSymFile'
`KeymapBusinessUKPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic and
positional mapping for the UK business keyboard (*note Keyboard
emulation::, PET and CBM-II).

`KeymapGraphicsSymFile'
`KeymapGraphicsPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic and
positional mapping for the graphics keyboard (*note Keyboard
emulation::, PET only).

`KeymapBusinessDESymFile'
`KeymapBusinessDEPosFile'
String specifying the name of the keymap file for the symbolic and
positional mapping for the German business keyboard.  (*note
Keyboard emulation::, PET only).


6.5.2 Keyboard command-line options
-----------------------------------

`-keymap N'
Specifies which keymap is being used; `0' indicates symbolic
mapping, `1' positional mapping (as for the `KeymapIndex'
resource).

`-symkeymap NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the symbolic keymap file (`KeymapSymFile').

`-poskeymap NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the positional keymap file (`KeymapPosFile').

`-symdekeymap NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the symbolic keymap file (`KeymapSymDeFile').

`-buksymkeymap NAME'
`-bukposkeymap NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the symbolic/positional keymap file for the UK
business keyboard (`KeymapBusinessUKSymFile',
`KeymapBusinessUKPosFile', PET and CBM-II).

`-grsymkeymap NAME'
`-grposkeymap NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the symbolic/positional keymap file for the
graphics keyboard (`KeymapGraphicsSymFile',
`KeymapGraphicsPosFile', PET only).

`-bdesymkeymap NAME'
`-bdeposkeymap NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the symbolic/positional keymap file for the
German business keyboard (`KeymapBusinessDESymFile',
`KeymapBusinessDEPosFile', PET only).


6.6 Joystick settings
=====================

6.6.1 Joystick command-line options
-----------------------------------

`-joydev1 <0-8>'
`-joydev2 <0-8>'
Set the device for joystick emulation of port 1 and 2, respectively
(`JoyDevice1', `JoyDevice2').

`-extrajoydev1 <0-8>'
`-extrajoydev2 <0-8>'
Set device for extra joystick port 1 and 2.

`-mouse'
`+mouse'
Enable/Disable mouse grab

`-mousetype <value>'
Select the mouse type (0 = 1351, 1 = NEOS, 2 = Amiga, 3 = Paddles)

`-mouseport <value>'
Select the joystick port the mouse is attached to

`-lightpen'
`+lightpen'
Enable/Disable lightpen emulation

`-lightpentype <type>'
Set lightpen type


6.7 Sound settings
==================

The following menu items control sound output:

* "Enable sound playback" turns sound emulation on and off.

* "Sound synchronization" specifies the method for syncronizing the
sound playback.  Possible settings are:
* "Flexible", i.e., the audio renderer flexibly adds/removes
samples to the output to smoothly adapt the playback to
slight changes in the speed of the emulator.

* "Adjusting" works like "flexible", but supports bigger
differences in speed.  For example, if the emulation speed
drops down from from 100% to 50%, audio slows down by the
same amount too.

* "Exact", instead, makes the audio renderer output always the
same sounds you would hear from the real thing, without
trying to adapt the ratio; to compensate the tolerances in
speed, some extra frames will be skipped or added.

* "Sample rate" specifies the sampling frequency, ranging from 8000
to 48000 Hz (not all the sound cards and/or sound drivers can
support all the frequencies, so actually the nearest candidate
will be chosen).

* "Buffer size" specifies the size of the audio buffer; the bigger
the buffer, the longer the delay with which sounds are played.
You should pick the smallest value your machine can handle without
problems.

* "Sound suspend time", will cause the audio playback to pause for
the specified number of seconds whenever some clicking happens.
If "Keep going" is selected, no pausing is done.

* "Oversample" specifies an oversampling factor, from 1 to 8 times
(warning: this eats CPU cycles!).


6.7.1 Sound resources
---------------------

`Sound'
Boolean specifying whether audio emulation is turned on.

`SoundSpeedAdjustment'
Integer specifying what speed adjustment method the audio renderer
should use.  Possible values are:
* `0': "flexible"

* `1': "adjusting"

* `2': "exact"

`SoundSampleRate'
Integer specifying the sampling frequency, ranging from 8000 to
48000 Hz (not all the sound cards and/or sound drivers can support
all the frequencies, so actually the nearest candidate will be
chosen).

`SoundBufferSize'
Integer specifying the size of the audio buffer, in milliseconds.

`SoundSuspendTime'
Integer specifying the pause interval when audio underflows
("clicks") happen.  `0' means no pause is done.

`SoundDeviceName'
String specifying the audio driver.

Implemented drivers are:

* `aix', for the IBM AIX sound driver.

* `uss', for the Linux/FreeBSD Universal Sound System driver
(`SoundDeviceArg' specifies the audio device, `/dev/dsp' by
default);

* `sgi', for the Silicon Graphics audio device (`SoundDeviceArg'
specifies the audio device, `/dev/audio' by default);

* `sun', for the Solaris audio device (unfinished;
`SoundDeviceArg' specifies the audio device, `/dev/audio' by
default).

* `hpux', for the HP-UX audio device (unfinished;
`SoundDeviceArg' specifies the audio device, `/dev/audio' by
default).

* `sdl', for the Simple DirectMedia Layer audio driver.

* `esd', for EsounD, the Enlightened Sound Daemon;
`SoundDeviceArg' specifies the ESD server (`host:port') to
connect, empty by default.

* `dummy', fully emulating the SID, but not actually playing
samples.

* `dump', writing all the write accesses to the registers to a
file (specified by `SoundDeviceArg', default value is
`vicesnd.sid');

* `speed', like `dummy' but also calculating samples (mainly
used to evaluate the speed of the sample generator);

* `fs', writing samples to a file (specified by
`SoundDeviceArg'; default is `vicesnd.raw');

These drivers will actually be present only if the VICE
configuration script detected the corresponding devices at the
time of compilation.

`SoundDeviceArg'
String specifying an additional parameter for the audio driver (see
`SoundDeviceName').


6.7.2 Sound command-line options
--------------------------------

`-sound'
`+sound'
Turns sound emulation on (`Sound=1') and off (`Sound=0').

`-soundsync N'
Specify `N' as the sound speed adjustment method
(`SoundSpeedAdjustment').

`-soundrate RATE'
Specifies the sound playback sample rate (`SoundSampleRate').

`-soundbufsize SIZE'
Specifies the size of the audio buffer in milliseconds
(`SoundBufferSize').

`-soundfragsize <value>'
Set sound fragment size (0 = small, 1 = medium, 2 = large)

`-sounddev NAME'
Specifies the name of the audio device (`SoundDeviceName').

`-soundarg ARG'
Specifies an additional parameter for the audio device
(`SoundDeviceArg').

`-soundrecdev <name>'
Specify recording sound driver

`-soundrecarg <args>'
Specify initialization parameters for recording sound driver


6.8 Tape settings
=================

These settings are used to control the hardware-level emulation of the
Tape drive.

6.8.1 Tape command-line options
-------------------------------

`-dsresetwithcpu'
`+dsresetwithcpu'
Enable/Disable automatic Datasette-Reset

`-dszerogapdelay <value>'
Set delay in cycles for a zero in the tap

`-dsspeedtuning <value>'
Set number of cycles added to each gap in the tap


6.9 Drive settings
==================

These settings are used to control the hardware-level emulation of the
Disk drives.  When hardware-level emulation is turned on, only drives 8
and 9 are being emulated.

The following settings affect both drives:

* "Enable true drive emulation" enables the (slow) hardware-level
emulation of the drives for maximum compatibility.  This must be
turned on for any of the following settings to have effect.

* "Drive sync factor" specifies the speed of the drive's CPU.  This
can be used to help loading certain programs that have trouble
with the default PAL setting (for example, programs designed for
NTSC machines).  The ratio is calculated as follows:

sync_factor = 65536 * clk_drive / clk_machine

where `clk_drive' and `clk_machine' are clock speeds in MHz.  The
menu lets you choose between the PAL and NTSC values, and also lets
you specify whatever value you want.  Be careful when changing it,
though, because a wrong value can break things and even corrupt
disk images.


The following settings, instead, are specific of each drive:

* "Drive model" specifies the model of the drive being emulated.
*Warning:* This will reset the drive.

* "Enable parallel cable" enables emulation of a SpeedDOS parallel
cable; if you switch this option on and replace the original
Commodore ROMs with SpeedDOS-compatible ones, you can speed up
loading/saving times.

* "Idle method" specifies which method the drive emulation should
use to save CPU cycles in the host CPU.  There are three methods:

* "Skip cycles": Each time the serial line is accessed by the
C64, the drive executes all the cycles since the last time it
ran.  If the number of elapsed cycles is larger than a
certain value, the drive discards part of them.

* "Trap idle": The disk drive is still emulated upon serial line
accesses as with the previous option, but it is also always
emulated at the end of each screen frame.  If the drive gets
into the DOS idle loop, only pending interrupts are emulated
to save time.

* "No traps": Like "Trap idle", but without any traps at all.
So basically the drive works exactly as with the real thing,
and nothing is done to reduce the power needs of the drive
emulation.

The first option ("Skip cycles") is usually best for performance,
as the drive is emulated as little as possible; on the other hand,
you may notice sudden slowdowns (when the drive executes several
cycles at once) and the LED status is never updated (because it
would not be possible to do correctly so).  Moreover, if the drive
tries to get in sync with the computer in some weird way and the
computer does not access the serial line for a long time, it is
possible that some cycles are discarded and the sync is lost.
Notice that this hack will have no effect on performance if a
program continuously reads from the IEC port, as the drive will
have to be fully emulated in any case (some stupid programs do
this, even when they don't actually need to use the drive).

The second option ("Trap idle") is usually a bit slower, as at
least interrupts are always emulated, but ensures the LED state is
always updated correctly and always keeps the drive and the
computer in sync.  On the other hand, if a program installs a
non-standard idle loop in the drive, the drive CPU has to be
emulated even when not necessary and the global emulation speed is
then _much_ slower.

* "40-track image support" specifies how 40-track ("extended") disk
images should be supported.  There are three possible ways:

* "Never extend" never extends disk images at all (so if a
program tries to write tracks beyond the 35th, it is not
allowed to do so);

* "Ask on extend" prompts the user as soon as a program tries
to write tracks beyond the 35th, and the user can then choose
whether he wants the disk image to be extended or not;

* "Extend on access" simply extends the disk image as soon the
program needs it, without prompting the user.

6.10 Peripheral settings
========================

VICE is able to support some special peripherals:

* "file system devices", pseudo-drives accessing the Unix file
system;

* printers.

These features depend on some "kernal traps" that replace the
existing routines in the original Commodore operating system with
custom-made C routines.

6.10.1 Settings for file system devices
---------------------------------------

These settings deal with the drive-like peripherals connected to the bus
of the emulated machine.  The first setting relates to the parallel
IEEE488 interface. With this interface a special engine is used to
listen to the bus lines to translates them to the filesystem code. Thus
the PET will always detect a drive for example, but it can also use
drives 10 and 11 even together with true disk drive emulation.

* "Enable virtual devices", enables the peripheral access via the
fast disk emulation (either kernal traps or IEEE488 interface).
Both, filesystem and disk image access via fast drive emulation,
are affected.

Four peripherals, numbered from 8 to 11, are accessible; each of
them provides the following settings:

* "File system access", if enabled, allows the device to emulate a
drive accessing a file system directory; note that when a disk
image is attached to the same drive, the directory is no longer
visible and the attached disk is used instead.

* "File system directory" specifies the directory to be accessed by
the drive.

* "Convert P00 file names", if enabled, allows access to P00 files
using their built-in name instead of the Unix one.

* "Create P00 files on save", if enabled, creates P00 files (instead
of raw CBM files) whenever a program creates a file.

Note that, by default, all drives except 11 create P00 files on save,
while drive 11 creates raw CBM files. Those files come without any
header, but also with the filename restrictions given by the operating
system VICE runs on.

6.10.1.1 Resources for file system devices

`FSDevice8ConvertP00'
`FSDevice9ConvertP00'
`FSDevice10ConvertP00'

`FSDevice11HideCBMFiles'
Booleans specifying whether non-P00 files should be invisible to
programs running in the emulator (do not hide by default).

`FSDevice8Dir'
`FSDevice9Dir'
`FSDevice10Dir'
`FSDevice11Dir'
Strings specifying the directories to which drives 8, 9, 10 and 11
have access.

`FSDevice10Dir' and `FSDevice11Dir').

`-flipname <name>'
Specify name of the flip list file image


6.10.2 Printer settings
-----------------------

The VICE emulators can emulate printers connected to either the IEC
buffer or the user port.  Emulation can be achieved by redirecting the
printer output to a file or by piping it through an external process.
This is defined by so-called "printer device file names"; a printer
device file name can be either a simple path, or a command name
preceeded by a pipe symbol `|'.

For example, printer device `filename' will cause the output to be
appended to the file `filename', while printer device `|lpr' will cause
the `lpr' command to be executed and be fed the printer output.  The
printer output will not be converted but saved as printed by the
emulated machine.

Up to three printer devices may be specified through the following
resources:

* device 1, whose default value is `print.dump';

* device 2, whose default value is `|lpr'.

* device 3, whose default value is `|petlp -F PS|lpr';

So, basically, by default printer device 1 will dump printer output
to `print.dump'; printer device 2 will print it via `lpr' directly to
the printer and device 3 will print it via `petlp' (a not-yet-complete
utility that will produce Postscript output from the Commodore printer
code) and then to the printer via `lpr'.

6.10.3 Disabling kernal traps
-----------------------------

If you have compatibility problems, you can completely disable Kernal
traps with the "Disable kernal traps" option.  This will of course
disable all the features that depend on it, such as the fast 1541
emulation (so you will have to turn true 1541 emulation on if you want
to be able to read or write disk images) and tape support.

6.10.3.1 Resources to control Kernal traps
..........................................

`VirtualDevices'
Boolean specifying whether all the mechanisms for virtual device
emulation should be enabled. Serial IEC devices use kernal traps,
parallel IEEE488 devices use an own IEEE488 engine. Both are
switched on and off with this resource.


6.10.3.2 Command-line options to control Kernal traps
.....................................................

`-virtualdev'
`+virtualdev'
Enable (`VirtualDevices=1') or disable (`VirtualDevices=0')
virtual devices.


6.11 RS232 settings
===================

The VICE emulators can emulate the RS232 device most of the machines
have.  The C64, C128 and VIC20 emulators emulate the userport RS232
interface at 300 and 1200 baud.  The C64 and C128 can also use the 9600
baud interface by Daniel Dallmann, using the shift registers of the two
CIA 6526 chips.  The PET can have a 6551 ACIA RS232 interface when
running as a SuperPET, and the CBM-II has such an ACIA by default.  The
C64 and C128 emulators can emulate an ACIA 6551 (also known as Datapump
for example) as extension at `$de**'.

Emulation can be achieved by either:

* connecting a real UNIX serial device;

* dumping to a file;

* piping through a process.

It is possible to define up to four UNIX serial devices, and then
decide which interface should be connected to which device.  This is
done by so-called "rs232 device file names"; an rs232 device file name
can be either a simple path, or a command name preceeded by a pipe
symbol `|'.  If the path specifies a special device (e.g. `/dev/ttyS0')
it is recognized by VICE and the emulator can set the baudrate.

For example, rs232 device `filename' will cause the output to be
written (not appended) to the file `filename', while printer device
`|lpr' will cause the `lpr' command to be executed and be fed the rs232
output.  The rs232 output will not be converted but saved as sent by
the emulated machine.  The same holds true for the rs232 input.  If the
command writes data to the standard output it will be caught by VICE
and sent back to the emulator.  Also the data sent by the pseudo device
will be sent back to VICE.

For example you can setup a null-modem cable between two serial ports
of your PC, setup one port for login and use the other in VICE.  Then
you can login from your emulator via the RS232 emulation and the
null-modem cable to your machine again.

You can not simply run a shell from VICE, as the shell will notice
that it does not run on its own pseudo terminal and will thus buffer its
output.  You need to write some program that opens an own pseudo
terminal and runs the shell from there (not yet finished).

Up to four RS232 devices may be specified through the following
resources:

* device 1, whose default value is `/dev/ttyS0';

* device 2, whose default value is `/dev/ttyS1';

* device 3, whose default value is `rs232.dump';

* device 4, whose default value is `|lpr'.

For the first two devices you can change the baudrate the tty device
is set to by specifying it on the commandline or in the menu.  This
baudrate is 9600 by default for the latter two, but can be changed only
by resources (The baudrate is independent from the baudrate the emulator
actually expects).

6.11.1 RS232 resources

`-rsuserdev <0-3>'
Specify device for the userport RS232 emulation (`RsUserDev'; C64,
C128 and VIC20).


6.11.3 RS232 usage example
--------------------------

Here we give you a simple example how to set up an emulated C64 using
the modem connected to your PC. The following list shows each step.

`Attach your modem to your PC at a serial port.'
Normally you should set it up to use the modem as "/dev/modem".

`start VICE'

`Setup VICE to use your modem as "serial device 1"'
Go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 device" to
"/dev/modem" (or the device where you attached your modem to) Then
go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 baudrate" to
the baudrate your modem should run at.    Watch out, e.g. on Linux
there is an additional multiplier   to multiply with the baudrate
(so e.g. 19200 gives 115200 or so baud)   See the "setserial"
manpage on Linux for example.    However, most modems should be
able to autodetect the speed to   the computer as well.

`Select the RS232 emulation your programs use'
If you want to use the Userport emulation, go to the RS232
settings and   change "Userport RS232 Device" to   "Serial 1". If
you want ACIA emulation (swiftlink or what's it called?)    then
change "ACIA $DE** device" to "Serial 1".

`Enable the emulation'
Go to the RS232 settings and select either "ACIA $DE** emulation"
or Userport 300/1200 baud or CIA 9600 baud emulation.

`Load your program and start it.'
If it is able to detect an   RS232 cartridge like swiftlink or so,
try to detect the ACIA emulation   if enabled.    Otherwise just
set the baudrate to either 300, 1200 or 9600 according   to what
you enabled in the VICE menu for the userport.


6.12 Monitor settings
=====================

This section lists command-line options specific to the built-in
monitor.

6.12.1 Monitor command-line options
-----------------------------------

`-moncommands FILENAME'
Execute the commands from the file `FILENAME' in the monitor after
starting up. This command line switch is mainly thought to load
labels and to set breakpoints.  Not all other commands are useful
to be executed in this way, some may even lead to strange effects.

`-initbreak <address>'
Set an initial breakpoint for the monitor. Addresses with prefix
"0x" are hexadecimal.

`-remotemonitor'
`+remotemonitor'
Enable/Disable remote monitor

`-remotemonitoraddress <name>'
The local address the remote monitor should bind to


6.13 Machine settings
=====================

6.13.1 Machine command-line options
-----------------------------------

`-pal'
Use PAL sync factor

`-ntsc'
Use NTSC sync factor

`-ntscold'
Use old NTSC sync factor

`-paln'
Use PAL-N sync factor


6.14 Memory settings
====================

6.14.1 Memory command-line options
----------------------------------

`-raminitstartvalue <value>'
Set the value for the very first RAM address after powerup

`-raminitvalueinvert <num of bytes>'
Length of memory block initialized with the same value

`-raminitpatterninvert <num of bytes>'
Length of memory block initialized with the same pattern


6.15 Miscellaneous settings
===========================

This section lists generic resources that do not fit in the other
categories.

6.15.1 Miscellaneous resources
------------------------------

`Directory'
String specifying the search path for system files.  It is defined
as a sequence of directory names, separated by colons (`:'), just
like the `PATH' variable in the shell.  The special string `$$'
stands for the default search path, which is initialized at
startup to the following value:

LIBDIR/EMUID:$HOME/.vice/EMUID:BOOTPATH/EMUID:LIBDIR/DRIVES:$HOME/.vice/DRIVES:BOOTPATH/DRIVES

where:

* `LIBDIR' is the VICE installation directory (usually
`/usr/local/lib/vice', `/usr/lib/vice' or `/opt/vice/lib');

* `EMUID' is the emulation identification string (`C64',
`C128', `VIC20' or `PET');

* `BOOTPATH' is the directory where the binary lies (usually
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/bin' or `/opt/vice/bin').

* `DRIVES' is the directory called "DRIVES", where the disk
drive ROMs are.  (The disk drive ROMs are used by all
emulators, so there is an extra directory for them.)

Notice that the middle entry points to a default location in the
user's home directory. Here private ROM versions (e.g.  speeddos
or JiffyDos) can be stored for example.

*Note System files::. for a description of the method used to load
the emulator's system files.

`HTMLBrowserCommand'
String specifying the command to run the help browser.  The help
browser can be any HTML browser, and every `%s' in the string is
replaced with the name of the toplevel file of the VICE
documentation.  For example, the default value `netscape %s' runs
Netscape Navigator.

`SaveResourcesOnExit'
Boolean specifying whether the emulator should save changed

7 Machine-specific features
***************************

7.1 C64/128-specific commands and settings
==========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are C64/128 specific
and thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.1.1 Using cartridges
----------------------

The cartridge system is organized in "Slots" to allow more than one
cartridge connected at a time, like it can be done using an expansion
port expander on a real C64 (see below).

Generally a cartridge can be enabled by attaching its respective
cartridge image, or using the respective menu option for cartridges
that do not require an image.

x64, x64sc and x128 allow you to attach the following kinds of
images:

* `.crt' images, as used by the CCS64 emulator by Per Hkan Sundell

* raw `.bin' images, with or without load address

"Cartridge images" are like disk images, but contain the contents of
cartridge ROM and/or RAM images instead of disk images.

To attach cartridges, use the "Attach a cartridge image" submenu.
When using `.crt' images, this will work for every cartridge which is
supported. For raw `.bin' images you might have to use command line
options.

When you have successfully attached a cartridge image, you should
then reset the machine to make sure the cartridge initializes itself.
(Or enable the "reset on cartridge change" option).

Of course, it is also possible to detach a currently attached
cartridge image ("Detach cartridge image").

If you are using a freezer cart like an Action Replay cartridge, you
can emulate the cartridge's freeze button with the "Cartridge freeze"
command.

The imaginary expansion port expander is organized in 4 slots, the
cartridges are associated with them like this:

7.1.1.1 Slot 0
..............

All carts that have a passthrough connector go here. Once a "Slot 0"
cartridge is enabled all further cartridges are connected to its
respective passthrough port.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

"Slot 0" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means
enabling permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* IEEE-488 Interface
(`http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/c64/ieee-488/eprom.bin')

* Magic Voice

* MMC64

7.1.1.2 Slot 1
..............

Mostly RAM based cartridges which for one reason or the other might
make sense to be enabled together with one of the "Main Slot"
cartridges go here.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

"Slot 1" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means
enabling permanently

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* Double Quick Brown Box (DQBB)

* Expert Cartridge

* ISEPIC

* RamCart

7.1.1.3 Main Slot
.................

All other cartridges which are not pure i/o extensions go here.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

Cartridges in the "Main Slot" must be explicitly set as default to
enable them permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* generic 4K, 8K and 16K game- and ultimax cartridges

* Action Replay V5

* Action Replay MK2

* Action Replay MK3

* Action Replay MK4

* Atomic Power

* C64 Games System

* Capture

* Comal 80

* Dela EP64

* Dela EP7x8

* Dela EP256

* Diashow-Maker

* Dinamic

* EasyFlash

* Epyx FastLoad

* EXOS

* The Final Cartridge

* The Final Cartridge III

* Final Cartridge Plus

* Freeze Frame

* Freeze Machine

* Fun Play

* Game Killer

* IDE64 (`http://www.ide64.org/')

* KCS Power Cartridge

* MACH 5

* Magic Desk

* Magic Formel

* Mikro Assembler

* MMC Replay

* Ocean

* Prophet64

* REX 256k EPROM Cart

* REX Utility

* Retro Replay

* ROSS

* Simons' BASIC

* Snapshot 64

* Stardos

* Structured BASIC

* Super Explode V5.0

* Super Games

* Super Snapshot V4

* Super Snapshot V5

* Warp Speed

* Westermann Learning

* Zaxxon

7.1.1.4 I/O Slot
................

All carts that are pure I/O extensions go here.

Any number of "I/O Slot" Carts may be active at a time.

"I/O Slot" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means
enabling permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* ACIA (Swiftlink, Turbo232)

* DigiMAX

* Ethernet (The Final Ethernet, RR-Net)

* GEO-RAM

* MIDI (Passport/Syntech, Datel/Siel/JMS/C-Lab, Maplin, Namesoft,
Sequential)

* RAM Expansion Module (REU)

* SFX Sound Expander

* SFX Sound Sampler

7.1.1.5 Expected behaviour
..........................

When the emulator is run without arguments, all settings from the
config file should be applied and arguments override settings from the
config file.

When saving the settings to the config file it is expected that on
the next run of the emulator all settings will be in the same state as
they were when saved.

There is an exception to this rule: the cartridge in the "Main Slot"
must be explicitly set as default before it gets saved to the config
file.

`+cart' should disable ALL cartridges, including eventually
activated REU, Swithlink and all similar expansionport devices.

`-cartXYZ' options should generally attach AND activate a cart of
type XYZ.  As a consequence, attaching carts this way which are NOT in
the "Main Slot" will also enable the cart permanently.

7.1.1.6 Common problems
.......................

If attaching a cartridge does not work as expected, this may be because
of various reasons:

* Not seldomly the CRT type is incorrectly set in `.crt' files found
"in the wild".  Make sure this is not the case (if in doubt use
`cartconv' to verify and/or fix).

* You may have unintentionally enabled more than one cartridge at
once, for example by saving the settings with REU enabled, and
then later attaching a game cartridge from the command-line. The
cartridge system will allow certain combinations, but (as on the
real thing) not all do (can) actually work. To make sure this is
not the case, either detach all cartridges from the menus, or use
`+cart' on the command-line.

* The cartridge image might be broken. Try one from a different
source. If you are sure the dump is ok (for example because you
dumped it yourself) then make sure it is in proper linear order
(on some cartridges, for example "capture", address and/or data
lines at the eprom are shuffled around so a dump made with an
eprom burner can not be used as is).

* Last not least you might have encountered a bug in the emulation.
If you suspect this is the case, and you can still reproduce the
bug after checking the things above, please file a bug report
including the following information:

* attach your vicerc and a reference to the cartridge binaries

* if you can, comment in the respective DEBUGXYZ macros
prominently defined at the top of these files:
src/c64/cart/c64cart.c src/c64/cart/c64cartmem.c
src/c64/c64io.c src/c64/c64export.c and then recompile. this
will add debug output that might make it much easier to
locate certain problems.


7.1.1.7 IEEE-488 interface
..........................

To be able to use an IEEE drive, you need to enable IEEE emulation for
the emulator. To do this, follow the following steps:

Download the IEEE 488 ROM image from the CBM archives (formerly
known as FUNET) Attach that image with File/Attach cartridge
image/IEEE488 interface image.

Make sure you have a one-drive system only (that is, go to
Settings/Peripheral Setting, uncheck "use IEC device" for all devices,
go to Settings/Drive Settings and select "Floppy type" as "none" for
all drives other than drive 8.

After this, all drives can be selected in x64 and x128.

7.1.1.8 The Final Cartridge 3
.............................

The Final Cartridge 3 detects wether a mouse is connected when it
starts and disables mouse support if it doesnt detect one. So to make
mouse emulation work you must either enable it on the command line, or
reset the cartridge after enabling it from the user interface.

7.1.4 VIC-II settings
---------------------

These settings control the emulation of the VIC-II (MOS6569) video chip
used in both the C64 and the C128.

* "Sprite-sprite collisions" and "Sprite-background collisions", if
enabled, cause the hardware detection of sprite-to-sprite and
sprite-to-background collisions of the VIC-II to be emulated.  This
feature is used by many games, and disabling either of the two
detection systems can sometimes make you invincible (although
there is also a chance that also enemies become invincible then).

* "Color set" can be used to dynamically change the palette file
being used by choosing one of the available predefined color sets:

* `default.vpl' ("default"), the default VICE palette;

* `c64s.vpl' ("C64S"), palette taken from the shareware C64S
emulator by Miha Peternel.

* `ccs64.vpl' ("CCS64"), palette taken from the shareware CCS64
emulator by Per Hkan Sundell.

* `frodo.vpl' ("Frodo"), palette taken from the free Frodo
emulator by Christian Bauer
(http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/FRMain.html).

* `pc64.vpl' ("PC64"), palette taken from the free PC64
emulator by Wolfgang Lorenz.

* `godot.vpl' ("GoDot"), palette as suggested by the authors of
the C64 graphics package GoDot
(http://users.aol.com/howtogodot/welcome.htm).

7.1.5 SID settings
------------------

These settings control the emulation of the SID (MOS6581 or MOS8580)
audio chip.

* "Second SID" maps a second SID chip into the address space for
stereo sound. This emulates e.g. the "SID Symphony Stereo
Cartridge" from Dr. Evil Laboratories. The second SID can be used
with software such as "Stereo SID Player" by Mark Dickenson or
"The Enhanced Sidplayer" by Craig Chamberlain.

* "Second SID base address" sets the start address for the second SID
chip. Software normally uses $DE00 or $DF00, since $DE00-$DEFF and
$DF00-$DFFF can be mapped through the cartridge port of the C64.
The default start address is $DE00.

* "Emulate filters" causes the built-in programmable filters of the
SID chip to be emulated.  A lot of C64 music requires them to be
emulated properly, but their emulation requires some additional
processor power.

* "ChipModel" specifies the model of the SID chip being emulated:
there are two slightly different generations of SID chips: MOS6581
ones and MOS8580 ones.

* "Use reSID emulation" specifies whether the more accurate (and
resource hungry) reSID emulation is turned on or off.

* "reSID sampling method" selects the method for conversion of the
SID output signal to a sampling rate appropriate for playback by
standard digital sound equipment. Possible settings are:
* "Fast" simply clocks the SID chip at the output sampling
frequency, picking the nearest sample. This yields acceptable
sound quality, but sampling noise is noticeable in some
cases, especially with SID combined waveforms. The sound
emulation is still cycle exact.

* "Interpolating" clocks the SID chip each cycle, and
calculates each sample with linear interpolation. The
sampling noise is now strongly attenuated by the SID external
filter (as long as "Emulate filters" is selected), and the
linear interpolation further improves the sound quality.

* "Resampling" clocks the SID chip each cycle, and uses the
theoretically correct method for sample generation. This
delivers CD quality sound, but is extremely CPU intensive,
and is thus most useful for non-interactive sound generation.
Unless you have a very fast machine, that is.

* "reSID resampling passband" specifies the percentage of the total
bandwidth allocated to the resampling filter passband. The work
rate of the resampling filter is inversely proportional to the
remaining transition band percentage. This implies that e.g. with
the transition band starting at ~ 20kHz, it is faster to generate
48kHz than 44.1kHz samples. For CD quality sound generation at
44.1kHz the passband percentage should be set to 90 (i.e. the
transition band starting at almost 20kHz).

7.1.6 C64 I/O extension settings
--------------------------------

I/O extensions are (usually) cartridges which do not map into ROM space,
but use only the I/O space at address range $DE00 ... $DEFF and/or
$DF00 ... $DFFF.

Please use these extensions only when needed, as they might cause
compatibility problems.

The following I/O extensions are available:

* ACIA (Swiftlink, Turbo232)

* DigiMAX

* Ethernet (The Final Ethernet, RR-Net)

* GEO-RAM

* MIDI (Passport, Datel, Maplin, Namesoft, Sequential)

* REU - The "RAM Expansion Module" extension emulates a standard
Commodore RAM Expansion Unit; this can be used with GEOS and other
programs that are designed to take advantage of it.  This currently
works only in the C64 emulator.

* SFX Sound Expander

* SFX Sound Sampler

7.3 C64DTV-specific commands and settings
=========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are C64DTV specific
and thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.3.1 C64DTV ROM image
----------------------

The DTV has a 2MB Flash chip which contains the kernal, basic and
character set ROMs along with other data, such as games in the case of
the original C64DTV ROM.

The image file is a dump of the flash chip. It is exactly 2MB
(2097152 bytes).

If you do not have a suitable image file, an image using the C64
kernal, basic and charset is automatically created.

If writing to the C64DTV ROM is enabled, the image file is rewritten
with the current data when exiting x64dtv.

Note that x64dtv tries to load the image file from the C64DTV
directory first, and if it isn't found there, x64dtv tries to load it
from the current directory. If you do not have `dtvrom.bin' in your
C64DTV directory and writing to DTV ROM is enabled, the `dtvrom.bin'
file is created to the current directory.

NOTE: The original C64DTV ROM has somewhat distorted colors,
normally you should use a patched rom.

`-c64dtvromimage NAME'
Specify `NAME' as the C64DTV ROM image

`-c64dtvromrw'
`+c64dtvromrw'
Enable or disable writing to C64DTV ROM image


The trueflashfs option is analogous to True drive emulation.  If
disabled, any file access to the flash filesystem (device 1) will go to
the local file system instead.

`-trueflashfs'
`+trueflashfs'
Enable or disable true hardware flash file system

`-fsflash NAME'
Specify `NAME' as directory for flash file system device


7.3.2 DTV revision
------------------

The DTV revision 2 has a bug in the Blitter. Using revision 3 is
recommended. Emulation of DTV revision 2 including Blitter bug is
intended for testing DTV software.

`-dtvrev REVISION'
Specify DTV `REVISION' (2 or 3)


7.3.3 LumaFix
-------------

The PAL C64DTVs have wrong resistors in the video output circuit, which
causes incorrect luminances. Several hardware solutions ("LumaFixes")
have been developed to fix this flaw.

The fixed video output is emulated by selecting "New Luminances".
The unmodified C64DTV video output can be emulated with "Old
Luminances".

The default setting is "New Luminances".

7.3.4 Userport
--------------

The C64DTV userport emulation currently supports three devices: Hummer
ADC, userport joystick and PS/2 mouse.

The joystick that controls either the Hummer ADC or userport joystick
can be selected using the same parameter or menu option.

While using the Hummer ADC, joystick UP and DOWN are mapped to the
Hummer buttons A and B respectively. LEFT and RIGHT set the ADCs output
to 0 and 255. Centering the joystick results in the ADC value of 128.

Currently the Hummer ADC and userport joystick are mutually
exclusive.  This means that enabling one disables the other. PS/2 mouse
emulation can be used simultaneously with either Hummer ADC or userport
joystick.

`-hummeradc'
`+hummeradc'
Enable/Disable Hummer ADC

`-ps2mouse'
`+ps2mouse'
Enable or disable PS/2 mouse on userport


7.3.5 Debug
-----------

Debugging information on Blitter, DMA and Flash can be enabled with
command line parameters. This can be useful for DTV software
development.

`-dtvblitterlog'
`+dtvblitterlog'
Enable or disable DTV Blitter log

`-dtvdmalog'
`+dtvdmalog'
Enable or disable DTV DMA log

`-dtvflashlog'
`+dtvflashlog'
Enable or disable DTV Flash log


7.3.6 Monitor DTV features
--------------------------

Currently the registers A, Y and X are registers R0, R1 and R2
regardless of the mapping, which can be seen and modified via the
registers ACM and XYM.

The monitor can access all 2MB of RAM and 2MB of Flash, but only 64
kB at a time.  The 64kB bank can be selected with "bank ram00".."ram1f"
for RAM and "bank rom00".."rom1f" for Flash.

The "load" command can load large files (>64kB) correctly if the
bank is set to "ramXX", where XX is the starting bank (usually
"bank00").

7.4 VIC20-specific commands and settings
========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are VIC20-specific and
thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.4.1 Using cartridge images
----------------------------

As with the C64 (*note C64 cartridges::), it is possible to attach
several types of cartridge images:

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $2000;

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $4000;

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $6000;

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $A000;

* 4 Kbyte cartridges located at $B000.

This can all be done via the "Attach cartridge image..." command in
the left-button menu.  It is also possible to let xvic "guess" the type
of cartridge using "Smart-attach cartridge image...".

Notice that several cartridges are actually made up of two pieces
(and two files), that need to be loaded separately at different
addresses.  In that case, you have to know the addresses (which are
usually specified in the file name) and use the "attach" command twice.

A special kind of cartridge file is where the two files mentioned
above are concatenated (with removing the two byte load address of the
second image) into one 16k image. There are only few of those images,
though. Normally the second part is located at $A000.  Vice can now
attach such concatenated files at the start address $2000, $4000, and
$6000. The second half of such an image is moved to $A000. If you
encounter 16k images that have the second half not at $A000 you can
split the image into two halfs (i.e. one 8194 byte and one 8192 byte,
because the first has the load address) and attach both files
separately.

One cartridge that is currently only partially supported here is the
VIC1112 IEEE488 interface. You have to load the ROM as a cartridge, but
you also have to enable the IEEE488 hardware by menu.

7.4.4 Changing memory configuration
-----------------------------------

It is possible to change the VIC20 memory configuration in two ways: by
enabling and/or disabling certain individual memory blocks, or by
choosing one among a few typical memory configurations.  The former can
be done by modifying resource values directly or from the right-button
menu; the latter can only be done from the menu.

There are 5 RAM expansion blocks in the VIC20, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3
and 5:

* block 0 (3 Kbytes at $0400-$0FFF);

* block 1 (8 Kbytes at $2000-$3FFF);

* block 2 (8 Kbytes at $4000-$5FFF);

* block 3 (8 Kbytes at $6000-$7FFF);

* block 5 (8 Kbytes at $A000-$BFFF).

These blocks are called "expansion blocks" because they are not
present a stock ("unexpanded") machine.  Each of them is associated to
a boolean `RamBlockX' resource (where `X' is the block number) that
specifies whether the block is enabled or not.

There are also some common memory configurations you can pick from
the right-button menu:

* no RAM expansion blocks at all;

* all RAM expansion blocks enabled;

* 3K expansion (only block 0 is enabled);

* 8K expansion (only block 1 is enabled);

* 16K expansion (only blocks 1 and 2 are enabled);

* 24K expansion (only blocks 1, 2 and 3 are enabled).

7.4.4.1 VIC20 memory configuration resources
............................................

`RAMBlock0'
`RAMBlock1'
`RAMBlock2'
`RAMBlock3'
`RAMBlock5'
Booleans specifying whether RAM blocks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 must be
enabled.


7.4.4.2 VIC20 memory configuration command-line options
.......................................................

`-memory CONFIG'
Specify memory configuration.  It must be a comma-separated list of
options, each of which can be one the following:

* `none' (no extension);

* `all' (all blocks);

* `3k' (3k space in block 0);

* `8k' (first 8k extension block);

* `16k' (first and second 8k extension blocks);

* `24k' (first, second and 3rd extension blocks);

* `0', `1', `2', `3', `5' (memory in respective blocks);

* `04', `20', `40', `60', `A0' (memory at respective address.

For example,

xvic -memory none

gives an unexpanded VIC20.  While

xvic -memory 60,a0

or

xvic -memory 3,5

enables memory in blocks 3 and 5, which is the usual configuration
for 16k ROM modules.


7.4.5 VIC20 system ROM settings

7.6 PET-specific commands and settings
======================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are PET-specific and
thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.6.1 Changing PET model settings
---------------------------------

With `xpet', it is possible to change at runtime the characteristics of
the emulated PET so that it matches (or not) the ones of a certain PET
model, and it is also possible to select from a common set of PET
models so that all the features are selected accordingly.

The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

`RamSize'
Size of memory in kByte. 96k denotes a 8096, 128k a 8296.

`IOSize'
Size of I/O area in Byte.  Either 2048 or 256 for 8296.

`VideoSize'
The number of columns on the screen (40 or 80).  A 0 auto-detects
this from the ROM.

`Ram9'
The 8296 can map RAM into the address range $9***

`RamA'
The 8296 can map RAM into the address range $A***

`SuperPET'
This resource enables the SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) I/O and
disables the 8x96 mappings.

`Basic1'
If (by checksum) a version 1 kernal is detected, then the kernal
ROM is patched to make the IEEE488 interface work.

`Basic1Chars'
Exchanges some character in the character ROM that have changed
between the first PET 2001 and all newer versions.

`EoiBlank'
This resource enables the "blank screen on EOI" feature of the
oldest PET 2001.

`DiagPin'
Set the diagnositc pin on the PET userport (see below).

`ChargenName'
Specify `NAME' as the character generator ROM file

`KernalName'
Specify `NAME' as the kernal ROM file.  This file contains the
complete BASIC, EDITOR and KERNAL ROMs and is either 16k (BASIC 1
and 2) or 20k (BASIC 4) in size.

`EditorName'
Specify `NAME' as the editor ROM file.  This file contains an
overlay for the editor ROM at $E000-$E7FF if necessary.

`RomModule9Name'
Specify `NAME' as the $9*** Expansion ROM file.  This file contains
an expansion ROM image of 4k.

`RomModuleAName'
Specify `NAME' as the $A*** Expansion ROM file.  This file contains
an expansion ROM image of 4k.

`RomModuleBName'
Specify `NAME' as the $B*** Expansion ROM file.  This file contains
an expansion ROM image of 4k.  This file overlays the lowest 4k of
a BASIC 4 ROM.


Choosing a common PET model is done from the right-button menu
instead, by choosing an item from the "Model defaults" submenu.
Available models are:

* PET 2001-8N

* PET 3008

* PET 3016

* PET 3032

* PET 3032B

* PET 4016

* PET 4032

* PET 4032B

* PET 8032

* PET 8096

* PET 8296

* SuperPET

Notice that this will *reset the emulated machine*.

It is also possible to select the PET model at startup, with the
`-model' command-line option: for example, `xpet -model 3032' will
emulate a PET 3032 while `xpet -model 8296' will emulate a PET 8296.

It is possible to enable or disable emulation of the PET diagnostic pin
via the `DiagPin' resource, or the "PET userport diagnostic pin" item
in the right-button menu.

When the diagnostic pin is set, the Kernal does not try to initialize
the BASIC, but directly jumps into the builtin machine monitor.

7.6.5 Changing screen colors
----------------------------

It is also possible to choose what color set is used for the emulation
window.  This is done by specifying a palette file name (*note Palette
files::) in the `PaletteName' resource.  The menu provides the
following values:

* `green.vpl' (default, "green)"), the good old green-on-black
feeling;

* `amber.vpl' ("amber"), an amber phosphor lookalike;

* `white.vpl' ("white"), simple white-on-black palette.

7.7 CBM-II-specific commands and settings
=========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are CBM-II-specific
and thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.7.1 Changing CBM-II model
---------------------------

With `xcbm2', it is possible to change at runtime the characteristics
of the emulated CBM so that it matches (or not) the ones of a certain
CBM model, and it is also possible to select from a common set of CBM
models so that all the features are selected accordingly.

The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

`UseVicII'
Whether to use VIC-II for video output (value 1) or the CRTC for
the other machines (value 0)

`RamSize'
Size of memory in kByte.  Possible values are 128, 256, 512 and
1024

`Ram08, Ram1, Ram2, Ram4, Ram6, RamC'
Expanded CBM-II models could map RAM to the expansion ROM areas at
$0800-$0fff, $1000-$1fff, $2000-$3FFF, $4000-$5FFF, $6000-$7FFF
and $c000-$cfff respectively.

`Cart2Name, Cart4Name, Cart6Name'
Specify `NAME' as the $2000-$3FFF, $4000-$5FFF or $6000-$6FFF
Expansion ROM file.  This file contains an 8k ROM dump.

`ModelLine'
The CBM-II business models have two hardcoded lines at one of the
I/O ports.  From those lines the kernal determines how it should
init the CRTC video chip for either 50Hz (Europe) or 60Hz (North
America), and either for 8 (C6x0) or 14 (C7x0) scanlines per
character.  0 = CBM 7x0 (50Hz), 1 = 60Hz C6x0, 2 = 50Hz C6x0).


Choosing a common CBM-II model is done from the right-button menu
instead, by choosing an item from the "Model defaults" submenu.
Available models are:

* C510 (128k RAM)

* C610 (128k RAM)

* C620 (256k RAM)

* C620+ (1024k RAM, expanded)

* C710 (128k RAM)

* C720 (256k RAM)

* C720+ (1024k RAM, expanded)

Notice that this will *reset the emulated machine*.

Warning: At this time switching between 510 and other machines during
runtime is not supported and will not work.

It is also possible to select the CBM model at startup, with the
`-model' command-line option: for example, `xcbm2 -model 610' will
emulate a CBM 610 while `xcbm2 -model 620' will emulate a CBM 620.
Notably this is the only way to start a C510 emulation, with `-model
510'.

7.7.2 CBM-II command line options

7.7.3 Changing screen colors
----------------------------

It is also possible to choose what color set is used for the emulation
window.  This is done by specifying a palette file name (*note Palette
files::) in the `PaletteName' resource.  The menu provides the
following values:

* `green.vpl' (default, "green"), the good old green-on-black
feeling;

* `amber.vpl' ("amber"), an amber phosphor lookalike;

* `white.vpl' ("white"), simple white-on-black palette.

7.8 VSID-specific commands and settings
=======================================

7.8.1 VSID settings
-------------------

7.8.1.1 VSID command-line options
.................................

`-vsid'

`-keepenv'
Override PSID settings for Video standard and SID model

`-tune <number>'

8 Snapshots
***********

Every VICE emulator has a built-in snapshot feature, that saves the
complete emulator state into one file for later use.  You can therefore
save the emulator state - including the state of the game you are
playing for example - in a single file.

8.1 Snapshot usage
==================

A snapshot is one file containining the complete emulator state.  A
snapshot file can be generated by selecting the "Save snapshot" command
at any time.  This will pop up a requester from which you can specify
whether the snapshot should also contain the disk and ROM status.

A snapshot file can be used to restore the emulator state by
selecting the `load snapshot' menu entry at any time.  Unfortunately
attached ROM images/cartridges are only supported in the VIC20, the PET
and the CBM-II emulators at this time.

The memory configuration of the emulator is saved in the snapshot
file as well. This configuration is restored when the snapshot is
loaded.

A quick snapshot can now be made by pressing the `M-F11' key and
reloaded by pressing the `M-F10' key.

8.2 Snapshot format
===================

A snapshot file consists of several modules of mostly different types.
Each module has a name and saves the state of an entity like a CIA, the
CPU, or the memory.

8.2.1 Emulator modules

The snapshot either contains CRTC or VIC-II snapshot modules, but
not both. Currently switching between the two video emulations is not
possible at runtime, so only snapshots that fit the current UseVicII
resource are accepted.

8.2.1.6 Drive modules
.....................

The modules for the real disk drive emulation are included in the
emulator when the emulation is enabled during the writing of the
snapshot.

Name    Type                          Description
*CPU    6502                          The Drive 0 CPU
*       *                             *

8.2.2 Module formats
--------------------

This section shows the basic module framework and the contents of the
different types of modules.

The single chip modules contain the chip state, not the state of the
emulator.  We tried to make the format as implementation-independent as
possible, to allow reuse of snapshots in later versions of this
emulator, or even in other emulators.

8.2.2.1 Terminology
...................

In this section we use certain abbreviations to define the types of the
data saved in the snapshot.

`BYTE'
8 bit integer.

`WORD'
16 bit integer.  Saved with low-byte first, high-byte last.

`DWORD'
32 bit integer.  Saved with low-word first, then high-word.  Each
word saved with its low-byte first.

`ARRAY'
Array of BYTE values.  Length depends on the description.

The tables for the single modules state the type, name and
description of the data saved in the modules.  The data is saved in the
order it is in the tables, so no offset is given.

8.2.2.2 Module framework
........................

The VICE snapshot file starts with the magic string and includes the
fileformat version number.

Type    Name                          Description
19 BYTE MAGIC                         "VICE Snapshot File032", padded
with 0
BYTE    VMAJOR                        fileformat major version number
BYTE    VMINOR                        fileformat minor version number
16 BYTE MACHINENAME                   Name of emulated machine, like
"PET", "CBM-II", "VIC20", "C64" or
"C128". zerobyte-padded.

The file header is followed by a number of different snapshot
modules.

Each module has a header with the information given in the table
below.  The header includes two version numbers, VMAJOR and VMINOR.
Modules with the same VMAJOR should be able to be exchanged.  I.e.
higher VMINOR numbers only append to the data for lower VMINOR.  This
additional data is ignored by older restore routines.  The other way
around newer restore routines must accept the fewer info from lower
VMINOR dumps.  Changes in VMAJOR might introduce any incompatibility
you like, but that's what VMAJOR is for after all :-)

Type    Name                          Description
16 BYTE MODULENAME                    The name of the module in ASCII,
padded with 0 to 16 byte.
BYTE    VMAJOR                        major version number
BYTE    VMINOR                        minor version number
DWORD   SIZE                          size of the module, including this
header

8.2.2.3 CPU module
..................

This module saves the core 6502 state.  You will find a clock value
there.  All other modules save their own clock values relative to this
value.  However, the drive modules save their clocks relative to their
appropriate CPUs of course.

Warning: This module is still under construction and saves some
information that is not sure to be VICE-independent.  If in doubt, read
the source.

Type    Name                          Description
DWORD   CLK                           the current CPU clock value.  All
other clock values are relative to
this.

The last two items have been added in CIA snapshot version 1.1 due
to the improved CIA emulation in the newer VICE versions.  Some state
bits correspond to the CIA state as described in the "A Software Model
of the CIA 6526" document by Wolfgang Lorenz, some are delayed
versions. For more read the source file `ciatimer.h'.

8.2.2.5 VIA module

8.2.2.9 SID module
..................

Warning: This module is still under construction.

8.2.2.10 ACIA module
....................

The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip.  VICE emulates RS232
connections via `/dev/ttyS*' (Unix) or `COM:' (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.  The
state of the ACIA however is restored if possible.  I.e. if a connection
is already open when restoring the snapshot, this connection is used
instead.  If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR drop is emulated.

8.2.2.13 CRTC module
....................

Warning: After VICE version 1.0 the CRTC emulation has improved
considerably. Especially it is now cycle exact. Therefore a lot more
variables must be saved. The snapshot module version jumped from 0.0 to
1.0. Newer versions of VICE can read the old snapshots, but older
versions (1.0 and below) cannot read the new snapshots.

Warning: This module is still under construction.  Especially the
RASTERY and RASTERLINE values might be bogus.

8.2.2.14 C64 memory module
..........................

The C64 memory module actually consists of two modules.  The "C64MEM"
module is mandatory and contains the RAM dump.  The "C64ROM" module is
optional and contains a dump of the ROM images.

The size of the C64 memory modules differs with each different memory
configuration. The RAM configuration is saved in the snapshot, and
restored when the snapshot is loaded. The attached cartridges are not
yet(!) saved and not yet restored upon load.

The RAM* arrays are only saved if the RAM itself is less than 1M.
If the memory size is 1M then those areas are taken from the bank 15
area of the normal RAM.

The memory array starts at $10000 if the memory size is less than
512k, or at $00000 if 512k or more. In case of a C510, then the memory
array also always starts at $00000.

11 Monitor
**********

Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be used
to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as well
as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using the
"Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that you have to
run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as `rxvt' or
`xterm') in order to use the monitor.

Warning: this version of the monitor is still under construction,
and some of the features are not fully working yet.

11.1 Terminology
================

`address_space'
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of
registers.  This can be the addresses available to the computer's
processor, the disk drive's processor or a specific memory
configuration of one of the mentioned processors.

`bankname'
The CPU can only see 64k of memory at any one time, due to its 16
bit address bus. The C64 and other computers have more than this
amount, and this is handled by banking: a memory address can have
different contents, depending on the active memory bank.  A
bankname names a specific bank in the current address_space.

`register'
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

`address'
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

`address_range'
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both addresses
must be in the same address space.

`address_opt_range'
An address or an address range.

`label'
`label' is the name of a label. it must start with a dot (".")  in
order for the monitor to recognize it as a label.

`prompt'
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second
part of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

`checkpoint'
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an
action when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types of
checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

`breakpoint'
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
triggered, the monitor is entered.

`tracepoint'
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

`watchpoint'
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.
When a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

`memmap'
The memmap keeps track of RAM/ROM/IO read/write/execute accesses.
The feature must be enabled with "-enable-memmap" configure
option, as it might decrease performance notably on slower
hardware. The option also enables CPU history.

`<...>'
A data type.

`*'
Zero or more occurrences.

`[...]'
An optional argument.


11.2 Machine state commands
===========================

`backtrace'
`bt'
Print JSR call chain (most recent call first). Stack offset
relative to SP+1 is printed in parentheses. This is a best guess
only.

`cpuhistory [<count>]'
`chis [<count>]'
Show <count> last executed commands.  (disabled by default;
configure with -enable-memmap to enable)

`dump "<filename>"'
Write a snapshot of the machine into the file specified.  This
snapshot is compatible with a snapshot written out by the UI.
Note: No ROM images are included into the dump.

`goto <address>'
`g <address>'
Change the PC to address and continue execution.

`io [<address>]'
Display i/o registers. Invoking without an address shows a dump of
the entire io range, if an address is given then details for the
chip at the respective (base-)address are displayed (if available).

`next [<count>]'
`n [<count>]'
Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as a
single instruction.

`registers [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
`r [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
Assign respective registers.  With no parameters, display register
values.

`reset [<type>]'
Reset the machine or drive.  `type': 0 = soft, 1 = hard, 8-11 =
drive.

`return'
`ret'
Continues execution  and returns to the monitor just after the
next RTS or RTI is executed.

`step [<count>]'
`z [<count>]'
Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows
stepping more than a single instruction at a time.

`undump "<filename>"'
Read a snapshot of the machine from the file specified.


11.3 Memory commands
====================

`bank [<bankname>]'
Without a bankname, display all available banks for the current
address_space. With a bankname given, switch to the specified
bank. If a bank is not completely filled (ROM banks for example)
normally the `ram' bank is used where the bank has holes.  The
`cpu' bank uses the bank currently used by the CPU.

`compare <address_range> <address>'
`c <address_range> <address>'
Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to
the destination specified by the address.  The regions may
overlap.  Any values that miscompare are displayed using the
default displaytype.

`device [c:|8:|9:]'
Set the default address space to either the computer `c:' or the
specified drive `8:' or `9:'

`fill <address_range> <data_list>'
`f <address_range> <data_list>'
Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
<data_list>.  If the size of the address range is greater than the
size of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

`hunt <address_range> <data_list>'
`h <address_range> <data_list>'
Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
<data_list>.  If the data is found, the starting address of the
match is displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible
matches.  The data list may have `xx' as a wildcard.

`i <address_opt_range>'
Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

`ii <address_opt_range>'
Display memory contents as screen code text

`mem [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`m [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the
default is used.  If only one address is specified, the length of
data displayed is based on the datatype.  If no addresses are
given, the 'dot' address is used.

`memmapshow [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`mmsh [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Show the memmap. The mask can be specified to show only those
locations with accesses of certain type(s). The mask is a number
with the bits "ioRWXrwx", where RWX are for ROM and rwx for RAM.
Optionally, an address range can be specified.  (disabled by
default; configure with -enable-memmap to enable)

`memmapzap'
`mmzap'
Clear the memmap.  (disabled by default; configure with
-enable-memmap to enable)

`memmapsave "<filename>" <format>'
`mmsave "<filename>" <format>'
Save the memmap as a picture. `format': 0 = BMP, 1 = PCX, 2 = PNG,
3 = GIF, 4 = IFF.  (disabled by default; configure with
-enable-memmap to enable)

`memchar [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`mc [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one
address is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no
addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`memsprite [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
`ms [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one
address is specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no
addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

`move <address_range> <address>'
`t <address_range> <address>'
Move memory from the source specified by the address range to the
destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

`screen'
`sc'
Displays the contents of the screen.

`sidefx [on|off|toggle]'
`sfx [on|off|toggle]'
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that
have read side-effects, like CIA interrupt registers for example.
If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'off' then reads don't cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'toggle' then the current mode is switched.  No
argument displays the current state.

`> [<address>] <data_list>'
Write the specified data at `address'.


11.4 Assembly commands
======================

`a <address> [ <instruction> [: <instruction>]* ]'
Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line
to exit assembly mode).

`disass [<address> [<address>]]'
`d [<address> [<address>]]'
Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they are
used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it is
treated as the start address and a default number of instructions
are disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a default number
of instructions are disassembled from the dot address.


11.5 Checkpoint commands
========================

`break [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid
checkpoints are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is
set for that address and the breakpoint number is printed.  The
"load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine on which operation the
monitor breaks. If not specified, the monitor breaks on "exec".  A
conditional expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

`enable <checknum>'

`disable <checknum>'
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
changing between these states.

`command <checknum> "<command>"'
When checkpoint `checknum' is hit, the specified command is
executed by the monitor.  Note that the `x' command is not yet
supported as a command argument.

`condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
`cond <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the
expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint is
examined, not when the condition is set.

Currently, the cond_expr is very limited. You can use registers
(.A, .X, .Y, .PC, and .SP) and compare against other registers or
absolute values. For example, the following are all valid
conditions: .A == 0, .X == .Y, 8:.X == .X, .A != 5, .A < .X.

However, you cannot specify memory contents and compare that.

`delete <checknum>'
`del <checknum>'
Delete the specified checkpoint.

`ignore <checknum> [<count>]'
Ignore a checkpoint after a given number of crossings.  If no
count is given, the default value is 1.

`trace [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
`tr [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
This command is similar to the `break' command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint by
not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the user
an execution trace.  The second optional address can be used to
specify the end of an range of addresses to be traced.  If no
addresses are given, a list of all the checkpoints is printed.
The "load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or
"exec" (or any combination of these) to determine which operation
the monitor traces. If not specified, the monitor traces all
operations.  A conditional expression can also be specified for
the tracepoint.  For more information on conditions, see the
CONDITION command.

`until [<address>]'
`un [<address>]'
If no address is given, the currently valid breakpoints are
printed.  If an address is given, a temporary breakpoint is set
for that address and the breakpoint number is printed.  Control is
returned to the emulator by this command.  The breakpoint is
deleted once it is hit.

`watch [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
`w [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
This command is similar to the `break' command except that it
operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from a breakpoint by
stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of
addresses.  If no addresses are given, a list of all the
checkpoints is printed.  The "load|store|exec" parameter can be
either "load", "store" or "exec" (or any combination of these) to
determine on which operation the monitor breaks. If not specified,
the monitor breaks on "load" and "store" operations.  A
conditional expression can also be specified for the watchpoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.


11.6 General commands
=====================

`cd <directory>'
Change the working directory.

`device [c:|d:]'
`dev [c:|d:]'
Set the default memory device to either the computer (`c:') or the
disk (`d:').

Display the directory contents.

`pwd'
Show current working directory.

`radix [H|D|O|B]'
`rad [H|D|O|B]'
Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
argument, the current radix is printed.


11.7 Disk commands
==================

`attach <filename> <device>'
Attach file to device. (device 32 = cart)

`block_read <track> <sector> [<address>]'
`br <track> <sector> [<address>]'
Read the block at the specified track and sector.  If an address is
specified, the data is loaded into memory.  If no address is given,
the data is displayed using the default datatype.

`block_write <track> <sector> <address>'
`bw <track> <sector> <address>'
Write a block of data at `address' to the specified track and
sector of disk in drive 8.

`detach <device>'
Detach file from device. (device 32 = cart)

`@<disk command>'
Perform a disk command on the currently attached disk image on
drive 8.  The specified disk command is sent to the drive's
channel #15.

`load "<filename>" <device> [<address>]'
`l "<filename>" <device> [<address>]'
Load the specified file into memory.  If no address is given, the
file is loaded to the address specified by the first two bytes
read from the file.  If address is given, the file is loaded to
the specified address and the first two bytes read from the file
are skipped.  If device is 0, the file is read from the file
system.

`list [<directory>]'
List disk contents.

`bload "<filename>" <device> <address>'
`bl "<filename>" <device> <address>'
Load the specified file into memory at the specified address.  If
device is 0, the file is read from the file system.

`save "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
`s "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.
Write two-byte load address.  If device is 0, the file is written
to the file system.

`bsave "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
`bs "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.
If device is 0, the file is written to the file system.


11.8 Command file commands
==========================

`playback "<filename>"'
`pb "<filename>"'
Monitor commands from the specified file are read and executed.
This command stops at the end of file or when a STOP command is
read.

`record "<filename>"'
`rec "<filename>"'
After this command, all commands entered are written to the
specified file until the STOP command is entered.

`stop'
Stop recording commands.  See `record'.


11.9 Label commands
===================

`add_label <address> <label>'
`al <address> <label>'
Map a given address to a label.  This label can be used when
entering assembly code and is shown during disassembly.
Additionally, it can be used whenever an address must be specified.

<label> is the name of the label; it must start with a dot (".") in
order for the monitor to recognize it as a label.

`delete_label [<memspace>] <label>'
`dl [<memspace>] <label>'
Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no memory
space is checked, all tables are checked.

`load_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
`ll [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no
memory space is specified, the default readspace is used.

The file must contain commands the monitor understands, e.g.
add_label. The compiler cc65 can create such label files.

Vice can also load label files created by the Acme assembler.
Their syntax is e.g. "labelname = $1234 ; Maybe a comment". A dot
will be added automatically to label names assigned in this way to
fit to the Vice label syntax. Normally the semicolon seperates
commands but after an assignment of this kind it may be used to
start a comment to end of line, so unchanged Acme label files can
be fed into Vice.

`save_labels [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
`sl [<memspace>] "<filename>"'
Save labels to a file.  If no memory space is specified, all of the
labels are saved.

`show_labels [<memspace>]'
`shl [<memspace>]'
Display current label mappings.  If no memory space is specified,
show all labels.


11.10 Miscellaneous commands

12 c1541
********

VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called `c1541'.

You can either invoke it from the command line or from within one of
the VICE emulators, using the "Run c1541" command which will open a new
`xterm' window with a running `c1541' in it.

The syntax is:

c1541 [IMAGE1 [IMAGE2]] [COMMAND1 COMMAND2 ... COMMANDN]

`IMAGE1' and `IMAGE2' are disk image names that can be attached
before `c1541' starts.  `c1541' can handle up to two disk images at the
same time by using two virtual built-in drives, numbered `8' and `9';
`IMAGE1' (if present) is always attached to drive `8', while `IMAGE2'
is attached to drive `9'.

`COMMAND's specified on the command-line all begin with the minus
sign (`-'); if present, `c1541' executes them in the same order as they
are on the command line and returns a zero error code if they were
successful.  If any of the `COMMAND's fails, `c1541' stops and returns
a nonzero error code.

If no `COMMAND's are specified at all, `c1541' enters interactive
mode, where you can type commands manually.  Commands in interactive
mode are the same as commands in batch mode, but do not require a
leading `-'.  As with the monitor, file name completion and command
line editing with history are provided via GNU `readline'.  Use the
command `quit' or press `C-d' to exit.

12.1 Specifying files in c1541
==============================

When accessing CBM DOS files (i.e. files that reside on disk images),
c1541 uses a special syntax that lets you access files on both drive 8
and 9.  If you prepend the file name with `@8:' or `@9:', you will
specified that file is to be found or created on drive 8 and 9,
respectively.

For instance,

@8:somefile

will name file named `somefile' on unit 8, while

@9:somefile

will name file named `somefile' on unit 9.

12.2 Using quotes and backslashes
=================================

You can use quotes (`"') in a command to embed spaces into file names.
For instance,

read some file

will read file `some' from the disk image and write it into the file
system as `file', while

read "some file"

will copy `some file' into the file system, with the name `some
file'.

The backslash character (`') has a special meaning too: it lets you
literally insert the following character no matter what it is.  For
example,

read some file

will copy file `some file' into the file system, while

read some file this"file

will copy `some file' into the file system with name `this"file'
(with an embedded quote).

12.3 c1541 commands and options
===============================

This is a list of the `c1541' commands.  They are shown in their
interactive form, without the leading `-'.  Square brackets [] indicate
an optional part, and "<COMMAND>" translates to a disk command
according to CBM DOS, like "i0" for example.

` [<command>]'
Execute specified CBM DOS command and print the current status of
the drive.  If no `command' is specified, just print the status.

`? [<command>]'
Explain specified command.  If no command is specified, list
available ones.

Delete the specified files.

`exit'
Exit (same as `quit').

`extract'
Extract all the files to the file system.

`format <diskname,id> [<type> <imagename>] [<unit>]'
If `unit' is specified, format the disk in unit `unit'.  If `type'
and `imagename' are specified, create a new image named
`imagename', attach it to unit 8 and format it.  `type' is a disk
image type, and must be either `x64', `d64' (both VC1541/2031),
`g64' (VC1541/2031 but in GCR coding), `d71' (VC1571), `d81'
(VC1581), `d80' (CBM8050) or `d82' (CBM8250/1001).  Otherwise,
format the disk in the current unit, if any.

`gcrformat <diskname,id> <imagename>'
Create and format a G64 disk image named `imagename'.

`help [<command>]'
Explain specified command.  If no command is specified, list
available ones.

`info [<unit>]'

current one).

`list [<pattern>]'
List files matching `pattern' (default is all files).

`quit'
Exit (same as `exit').

`read <source> [<destination>]'
Read `source' from the disk image and copy it into `destination' in
the file system.  If `destination' is not specified, copy it into a
file with the same name as `source'.",

`rename <oldname> <newname>'
Rename `oldname' into `newname'.  The files must be on the same
drive.

`tape <t64name> [<file1> ... <fileN>]'
Extract files from a T64 image.

`unit <number>'
Make unit `number' the current unit.

`unlynx <lynxname> [<unit>]'
Extract the specified Lynx image file into the specified unit
(default is the current unit).

`validate [<unit>]'
Validate the disk in unit `unit'.  If `unit' is not specified,
validate the disk in the current unit.

`write <source> [<destination>]'
Write `source' from the file system into `destination' on a disk
image.

`zcreate <x64name> <zipname> [<label,id>]'
Create an X64 disk image out of a set of four Zipcoded files named
`1!zipname', `2!zipname', `3!zipname' and `4!zipname'.


12.4 Executing shell commands
=============================

If you want to execute a shell command from withing `c1541', just
prepend it with an exclamation mark (`!').  For example,

!ls -la

will execute the command `ls -la', which will show you all the files
in the current directory.

12.5 c1541 examples
===================

`c1541 -attach test.d64 -write test.prg testfile'
Write `test.prg' to `test.d64' as `testfile'.

15 The emulator file formats
****************************

This chapter gives a technical description of the various files
supported by the emulators.

15.1 The T64 tape image format
==============================

(This section was taken from the C64S distribution.)

The `T64' File Structure was developed by Miha Peternel for use in
the C64S emulator.  It is easy to use and allows future extensions.

15.1.1 T64 File structure
-------------------------

Offset                 Size                   Description
0                      64                     tape record
64                     32*n                   file records for n directory
entries
64+32*n                varies                 binary contents of the files

15.1.2 Tape Record
------------------

Offset                 Size                   Description
0                      32                     DOS tape description + EOF
(for type)
32                     2                      tape version ($0200)
34                     2                      number of directory entries
36                     2                      number of used entries (can
be 0 in my loader)
38                     2                      free
40                     24                     user description as
displayed in tape menu

15.1.3 File record
------------------

Offset                 Size                   Description

2                      2                      start address
4                      2                      end address
6                      2                      free
8                      4                      offset of file contents
start within T64 file
12                     4                      free
16                     16                     C64 file name

Valid entry types are:

Code                   Explanation
`0'                    free entry
`1'                    normal tape file
`2'                    tape file with header: header is saved just
before file data
`3'                    memory snapshot v0.9, uncompressed
`4'                    tape block
`5'                    digitized stream
`6' ... `255'          reserved

Notes:

* VICE only supports file type `1'.

* Types `3', `4' and `5' are subject to change (and are rarely
used).

15.2 The G64 GCR-encoded disk image format
==========================================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Ettore Perazzoli.)

This format was defined in 1998 as a cooperative effort between
several emulator people, mainly Per Hkan Sundell, author of the CCS64
C64 emulator, Andreas Boose of the VICE CBM emulator team and Joe
Forster/STA, the author of Star Commander.  It was the first real public
attempt to create a format for the emulator community which removed
almost all of the drawbacks of the other existing image formats, namely
`D64'.

The intention behind `G64' is not to replace the widely used `D64'
format, as `D64' works fine with the vast majority of disks in
existence.  It is intended for those small percentage of programs which
demand to work with the 1541 drive in a non-standard way, such as
reading or writing data in a custom format.  The best example is with
speeder software such as Action Cartridge in Warp Save mode or Vorpal
which write track/sector data in another format other than standard
GCR.  The other obvious example is copy-protected software which looks
for some specific data on a track, like the disk ID, which is not
stored in a standard `D64' image.

`G64' has a deceptively simply layout for what it is capable of
doing.  We have a signature, version byte, some predefined size values,
and a series of offsets to the track data and speed zones.  It is what's
contained in the track data areas and speed zones which is really at the
heart of this format.

Each track entry in simply the raw stream of GCR data, just what a
read head would see when a diskette is rotating past it.  How the data
gets interpreted is up to the program trying to access the disk.
Because the data is stored in such a low-level manner, just about
anything can be done.  Most of the time I would suspect the data in the
track would be standard sectors, with SYNC, GAP, header, data and
checksums.  The arrangement of the data when it is in a standard GCR
sector layout is beyond the scope of this document.

Since it is a flexible format in both track count and track byte
size, there is no "standard" file size.  However, given a few constants
like 42 tracks and halftracks, a track size of 7928 bytes and no speed
offset entries, the typical file size will a minimum of 333744 bytes.

Below is a dump of the header, broken down into its various parts.
After that will be an explanation of the track offset and speed zone
offset areas, as they demand much more explanation.

Addr  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

0000: 47 43 52 2D 31 35 34 31 00 54 F8 1E .. .. .. ..

Offset         Description
$0000-0007     File signature (`GCR-1541')
$0008          `G64' version (presently only $00 defined)
$0009          Number of tracks in image (usually $54, decimal 84)
$000A-000B     Size of each stored track in bytes (usually 7928, or
$1EF8) in LO/HI format.

An obvious question here is "why are there 84 tracks defined when a
normal `D64' disk only has 35 tracks?"  Well, by definition, this image
includes all half-tracks, so there are actually 42 tracks and 42 half
tracks.  The 1541 stepper motor can access up to 42 tracks and the
in-between half-tracks.  Even though using more than 35 tracks is not
typical, it was important to define this format from the start with what
the 1541 is capable of doing, and not just what it typically does.

At first, the defined track size value of 7928 bytes may seem to be
arbitrary, but it is not.  It is determined by the fastest write speed
possible (speed zone 0), coupled with the average rotation speed of the
disk (300 rpm).  After some math, the answer that actually comes up is
7692 bytes.  Why the discrepency between the actual size of 7692 and the
defined size of 7928? Simply put, not all drives rotate at 300 rpm.
Some can be faster or slower, so a upper safety margin of +3% was built
added, in case some disks rotate slower and can write more data.  After
applying this safety factor, and some rounding-up, 7928 bytes per track
was arrived at.

Also note that this upper limit of 7928 bytes per track really only
applies to 1541 and compatible disks.  If this format were applied to
another disk type like the SFD1001, this value would be higher.

Below is a dump of the first section of a `G64' file, showing the
offsets to the data portion for each track and half-track entry.
Following that is a dump of the speed zone offsets.

Offset         Description
$015C-015F     Speed zone entry for track 1 ($03, in LO/HI  format, see
below for more)
$0160-0163     Speed zone entry for track 1.5 ($03)
...
$02A4-02A7     Speed zone entry for track 42 ($00)
$02A8-02AB     Speed zone entry for track 42.5 ($00)

Starting here at $02AC is the first track entry (from above, it is
the first entry for track 1.0)

The track offsets (from above) require some explanation.  When one is
set to all 0's, no track data exists for this entry.  If there is a
value, it is an absolute reference into the file (starting from the
beginning of the file).  From the track 1.0 entry we see it is set for
$000002AC.  Going to that file offset, here is what we see...

$02AC-02AD     Actual size of stored track (7692 or $1E0C, in LO/HI
format)
$02AE-02AE+$1E0CTrack data

Following the track data is filler bytes.  In this case, there are
368 bytes of unused space.  This space can contain anything, but for the
sake of those wishing to compress these images for storage, they should
all be set to the same value.  In the sample I used, these are all set
to $FF.

Below is a dump of the end of the track 1.0 data area.  Note the
actual track data ends at address $20B9, with the rest of the block
being unused, and set to $FF.

The speed offset entries can be a little more complex. The 1541 has
four speed zones defined, which means the drive can write data at four
distinct speeds.  On a normal 1541 disk, these zones are as follows:

Track Range                          Speed Zone
1-17                                 3  (highest writing speed)
18-24                                2
25-30                                1
31 and up                            0 (lowest writing speed)

Note that you can, through custom programming of the 1541, change the
speed zone of any track to something different (change the 3 to a 0) and
write data differently.  From the dump of the speed offset entries
above, we see that all the entries are in the range of 0-3. If any entry
is less than 4, this is not considered a speed offset but defines the
whole track to be recorded at that one speed.

In the example I had, there were no offsets defined, so no speed zone
dump can be shown.  However, I can define what should be there.  You
will have a block of data, 1982 bytes long.  Each byte is encoded to
represent the speed of 4 bytes in the track offset area, and is broken
down as follows:

Speed entry $FF:  in binary %11111111
|'|'|'|'
| | | |
| | | +- 4'th byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
| | +--- 3'rd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
| +----- 2'nd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
+------- 1'st byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)

It was very smart thinking to allow for two speed zone settings, one
in the offset block and another defining the speed on a per-byte basis.
If you are working with a normal disk, where each track is one constant
speed, then you don't need the extra blocks of information hanging
around the image, wasting space.

What may not be obvious is the flexibility of this format to add
tracks and speed offset zones at will.  If a program decides to write a
track out with varying speeds, and no speed offset exist, a new block
will be created by appending it to the end of the image, and the offset
pointer for that track set to point to the new block.  If a track has
no offset yet, meaning it doesn't exist (like a half-track), and one
needs to be added, the same procedure applies.  The location of the
actual track or speed zone data is not important, meaning they do not
have to be in any particular order since they are all referenced by the
offsets at the beginning of the image.

15.3 The D64 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

First and foremost we have D64, which is basically a
sector-for-sector copy of a 1540/1541 disk. There are several versions
of these which I will cover shortly. The standard D64 is a 174848 byte
file comprised of 256 byte sectors arranged in 35 tracks with a varying
number of sectors per track for a total of 683 sectors. Track counting
starts at 1, not 0, and goes up to 35. Sector counting starts at 0, not
1, for the first sector, therefore a track with 21 sectors will go from
0 to 20.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in circles,
with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the sides) to
track 35 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the inner hub
ring).  Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number of
sectors per track and data densities across the disk to optimize
available storage, resulting in the chart below. It shows the
sectors/track for a standard D64. Since the outside diameter of a
circle is the largest (versus closer to the center), the outside tracks
have the largest amount of storage.

(*) Tracks 36-40 apply to 40-track images only.

The directory track should be contained totally on track 18. Sectors
1-18 contain the entries and sector 0 contains the BAM (Block
Availability Map) and disk name/ID. Since the directory is only 18
sectors large (19 less one for the BAM), and each sector can contain
only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum number of directory
entries is 18 * 8 = 144. The first directory sector is always 18/1,
even though the t/s pointer at 18/0 (first two bytes) might point
somewhere else. It then follows the same chain structure as a normal
file, using a sector interleave of 3. This makes the chain links go
18/1, 18/4, 18/7 etc.

Note that you can extend the directory off of track 18, but only
when reading the disk or image. Attempting to write to a directory
sector not on track 18 will cause directory corruption. Each directory
sector has the following layout (18/1 partial dump):

00: 12 04 81 11 00 4E 41 4D 45 53 20 26 20 50 4F 53 <- notice the T/S link
10: 49 54 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 15 00 <- to 18/4 ($12/$04)
20: 00 00 84 11 02 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20 <- and how its not here
30: 49 4E 46 4F A0 11 0C FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 61 01 <- ($00/$00)

The first two bytes of the sector ($12/$04) indicate the location of
the next track/sector of the directory (18/4). If the track is set to
$00, then it is the last sector of the directory. It is possible,
however unlikely, that the directory may *not* be competely on track 18
(some disks do exist like this). Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The drive will return
all the available entries anyways.

This is a breakdown of a standard directory sector:

Bytes          Description
$00-$1F        First directory entry
$20-$3F        Second dir entry
$40-$5F        Third dir entry
$60-$7F        Fourth dir entry
$80-$9F        Fifth dir entry
$A0-$BF        Sixth dir entry
$C0-$DF        Seventh dir entry
$E0-$FF        Eighth dir entry

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00 $00
if not the first entry in the sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max. value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused (except with GEOS disks)
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx. filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE- replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange
results. The 1541 is inconsistent in how it treats these bits.  Some
routines use all 4 bits, others ignore bit 3, resulting in values from
0-7.

Files, on a standard 1541, are stored using an interleave of 10.
Assuming a starting track/sector of 17/0, the chain would run 17/0,
17/10, 17/20, 17/8, 17/18, etc.

*** Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory
track where all filenames are stored. This limits the number of files
stored on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.
There are some disk images that contain more files than would normally
be allowed. This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive. However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is
on and assume the default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track
18 to track 19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few slots
on 19/6. When saving a new file, the drive DOS will find an empty file
slot at 19/6 offset $40 and correctly write the filename and a few
other things into this slot. When the file is done being saved the
final file information will be written to 18/6 offset $40 instead of
19/6 causing some directory corruption to the entry at 18/6. Also, the
BAM entries for the sectors occupied by the new file will not be saved
and the new file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing
off the directory track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could also
send the drive into an endless loop. The default directory track is
assumed for all sector reads when validating so if the directory goes
to 19/6, then the validate code will read 18/6 instead. If 18/6 is part
of the normal directory chain then the validate routine will loop
endlessly.

*** BAM layout

The layout of the BAM area (sector 18/0) is a bit more complicated...

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of the first directory sector
(should be set to 18/1 but it doesn't matter, and don't
trust what is there, always go to 18/1 for first
directory entry)
$02            Disk DOS version type (see note below) $41 ("A")
$03            Unused
$04-$8F        BAM entries for each track, in groups of four bytes per
track, starting on track 1 (see below for more details)
$90-$9F        Disk Name (padded with $A0)
$A0-$A1        Filled with $A0
$A2-$A3        Disk ID
$A4            Usually $A0
$A5-$A6        DOS type, usually "2A"
$A7-$AA        Filled with $A0
$AB            Unused ($00)
$AC-$BF        For DOLPHIN DOS track 36-40 BAM entries, otherwise unused
($00)
$C0-$D3        For SPEED DOS track 36-40 BAM entries, otherwise unused
($00)
$D4-$FF
Unused ($00)

Note: The BAM entries for SPEED, DOLPHIN and ProLogic DOS use the
same layout as standard BAM entries. One of the interesting things from
the BAM sector is the byte at offset $02, the DOS version byte. If it
is set to anything other than $41 or $00, then we have what is called
"soft write protection". Any attempt to write to the disk will return
the "DOS Version" error code 73 ,"CBM DOS V 2.6 1541". The 1541 is
simply telling you that it thinks the disk format version is incorrect.
This message will normally come up when you first turn on the 1541 and
read the error channel. If you write a $00 or a $41 into 1541 memory
location $00FF (for device 0), then you can circumvent this type of
write-protection, and change the DOS version back to what it should be.

The BAM entries require a bit (no pun intended) more of a breakdown.
Take the first entry at bytes $04-$07 ($12 $FF $F9 $17).  The first
byte ($12) is the number of free sectors on that track.  Since we are
looking at the track 1 entry, this means it has 18 (decimal) free
sectors. The next three bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are
used/free. Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 24 bits of
storage. Remember that at most, each track only has 21 sectors, so
there are a few unused bits.

Bytes          Data                          Description
$04-$07        $12 $FF $F9 $17               Track 1 BAM
$08-$0B        $15 $FF $FF $FF               Track 2 BAM
$0C-$0F        $15 $FF $FF $1F               Track 3 BAM
...            ...                           ...
$8C-$8F        $11 $FF $FF $01               Track 35 BAM

These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense. We will
use the first entry (track 1) at bytes 04-07:

FF=11111111, F9=11111001, 17=00010111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222
01234567 89012345 67890123
--------------------------
11111111 10011111 11101000
^                     ^
sector 0           sector 20

Since we are on the first track, we have 21 sectors, and only use up
to the bit 20 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 has sectors 9, 10 and 19 used, all the rest are
free. Any leftover bits that refer to sectors that don't exist, like
bits 21-23 in the above example, are set to allocated.

Each filetype has its own unique properties, but most follow one
simple structure. The first file sector is pointed to by the directory
and follows a t/s chain, until the track value reaches $00. When this
happens, the value in the sector link location indicates how much of
the sector is used. For example, the following chain indicates a file 6
sectors long, and ends when we encounter the $00/$34 chain. At this
point the last sector occupies from bytes $02-$34.

1            2            3            4            5            6

(11/00)      (11/0A)      (11/14)      (11/01)      (11/0B)      (0/34)

*** Variations on the D64 layout

These are some variations of the D64 layout:

1. Standard 35 track layout but with 683 error bytes added on to the
end of the file. Each byte of the error info corresponds to a single
sector stored in the D64, indicating if the sector on the original disk
contained an error. The first byte is for track 1/0, and the last byte
is for track 35/16.

2. A 40 track layout, following the same layout as a 35 track disk,
but with 5 extra tracks. These contain 17 sectors each, like tracks
31-35. Some of the PC utilities do allow you to create and work with
these files. This can also have error bytes attached like variant #1.

3. The Commodore 128 allowed for "auto-boot" disks. With this, t/s
1/0 holds a specific byte sequence which the computer recognizes as
boot code.

Below is a small chart detailing the standard file sizes of D64
images, 35 or 40 tracks, with or without error bytes.

Disk type                            Size
35 track, no errors                  174848
35 track, 683 error bytes            175531
40 track, no errors                  196608
40 track, 768 error bytes            197376

The following table (provided by Wolfgang Moser) outlines the
differences between the standard 1541 DOS and the various "speeder"
DOS's that exist. The 'header 7/8' category is the 'fill bytes' as the
end of the sector header of a real 1541 disk.

*Note: There are also clones of SpeedDOS that exist, such as RoloDOS
and DigiDOS. Both are just a change of the DOS startup string.

The location of the extra BAM information in sector 18/0, for 40
track images, will be different depending on what standard the disks
have been formatted with. SPEED DOS stores them from $C0 to $D3,
DOLPHIN DOS stores them from $AC to $BF and PrologicDOS stored them
right after the existing BAM entries from $90-A3. PrologicDOS also
moves the disk label and ID forward from the standard location of $90
to $A4. 64COPY and Star Commander let you select from several different
types of extended disk formats you want to create/work with.

All three of the speeder DOS's mentioned above don't alter the
standard sector interleave of 10 for files and 3 for directories. The
reason is that they use a memory cache installed in the drive which
reads the entire track in one pass. This alleviates the need for custom
interleave values.  They do seem to alter the algorithm that finds the
next available free sector so that the interleave value can deviate
from 10 under certain circumstances, but I don't know why they would
bother.

Below is a HEX dump of a Speed DOS BAM sector. Note the location of
the extra BAM info from $C0-D3.

*** Error codes

Here is the meaning of the error bytes added onto the end of any
extended D64. The CODE is the same as that generated by the 1541 drive
controller... it reports these numbers, not the error code we usually
see when an error occurs.

Some of what comes below is taken from Immers/Neufeld book "Inside
Commodore DOS". Note the descriptions are not completely accurate as to
what the drive DOS is actually doing to seek/read/decode/write sectors,
but serve as simple examples only. The "type" field is where the error
usually occurs, whether it's searching for any SYNC mark, any header
ID, any valid header, or reading a sector.

These first errors are "seek" errors, where the disk controller is
simply reading headers and looking at descriptor bytes, checksums,
format ID's and reporting what errors it sees. These errors do *not*
necessarily apply to the exact sector being looked for. This fact makes
duplication of these errors very unreliable.

Code    : $03 Error   : 21 Type    : Seek Message : No SYNC sequence
found.

Each sector data block and header block are preceeded by SYNC marks.
If *no* sync sequence is found within 20 milliseconds (only ~1/10 of a
disk rotation!) then this error is generated. This error used to mean
the entire track is bad, but it does not have to be the case. Only a
small area of the track needs to be without a SYNC mark and this error
will be generated.

Converting this error to a D64 is very problematic because it
depends on where the physical head is on the disk when a read attempt
is made. If it is on valid header/sectors then it won't occur. If it
happens over an area without SYNC marks, it will happen.

Code    : $02 Error   : 20 Type    : Seek Message : Header
descriptor byte not found (HEX $08, GCR $52)

Each sector is preceeded by an 8-byte GCR header block, which starts
with the value $52 (GCR). If this value is not found after 90 attempts,
this error is generated.

Basically, what a track has is SYNC marks, and possibly valid data
blocks, but no valid header descriptors.

Code    : $09 Error   : 27 Type    : Seek Message : Checksum error
in header block

The header block contains a checksum value, calculated by XOR'ing
the TRACK, SECTOR, ID1 and ID2 values. If this checksum is wrong, this
error is generated.

Code    : $0B Error   : 29 Type    : Seek Message : Disk sector ID
mismatch

The ID's from the header block of the currently read sector are
compared against the ones from the low-level header of 18/0. If there
is a mismatch, this error is generated.

Code    : $02 Error   : 20 Type    : Seek Message : Header block not
found

This error can be reported again when searching for the correct
header block. An image of the header is built and searched for, but not
found after 90 read attempts. Note the difference from the first
occurance. The first one only searches for a valid ID, not the whole
header.

Note that error 20 occurs twice during this phase. The first time is
when a header ID is being searched for, the second is when the proper
header pattern for the sector being searched for is not found.

From this point on, all the errors apply to the specific sector you
are looking for. If a read passed all the previous checks, then we are
at the sector being searched for.

Note that the entire sector is read before these errors are
detected. Therefore the data, checksum and off bytes are available.

Code    : $04 Error   : 22 Type    : Read Message : Data descriptor
byte not found (HEX $07, GCR $55)

Each sector data block is preceeded by the value $07, the "data
block" descriptor. If this value is not there, this error is generated.
Each encoded sector has actually 260 bytes. First is the descriptor
byte, then follows the 256 bytes of data, a checksum, and two "off"
bytes.

Code    : $05 Error   : 23 Type    : Read Message : Checksum error
in data block

The checksum of the data read of the disk is calculated, and
compared against the one stored at the end of the sector. If there's a
discrepancy, this error is generated.

Code    : $0F Error   : 74 Type    : Read Message : Drive Not Ready
(no disk in drive or no device 1)

These errors only apply when writing to a disk. I don't see the
usefulness of having these as they cannot be present when only
*reading* a disk.

Code    : $06 Error   : 24 Type    : Write Message : Write verify
(on format)

Code    : $07 Error   : 25 Type    : Write Message : Write verify
error

Once the GCR-encoded sector is written out, the drive waits for the
sector to come around again and verifies the whole 325-byte GCR block.
Any errors encountered will generate this error.

Code    : $08 Error   : 26 Type    : Write Message : Write protect on

Self explanatory. Remove the write-protect tab, and try again.

Code    : $0A Error   : 28 Type    : Write Message : Write error

In actual fact, this error never occurs, but it is included for
completeness.

This is not an error at all, but it gets reported when the read of a
sector is ok.

Code    : $01 Error   : 00 Type    : N/A Message : No error.

Self explanatory. No errors were detected in the reading and
decoding of the sector.

The advantage with using the 35 track D64 format, regardless of
error bytes, is that it can be converted directly back to a 1541 disk
by either using the proper cable and software on the PC, or send it
down to the C64 and writing it back to a 1541. It is the best
documented format since it is also native to the C64, with many books
explaining the disk layout and the internals of the 1541.

15.4 The X64 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This file type, created by Teemu Rantanen, is used on the X64
emulator (a UNIX-based emulator) which has been superceeded by VICE.
Both VICE and X64 support the X64 file standard, with VICE also
supporting the regular D64 and T64 files.

X64 is not a specific type of file, but rather encompasses *all*
known C64 disk types (hard disk, floppies, etc). An X64 is created by
prepending a 64-byte header to an existing image (1541, 1571, etc) and
setting specific bytes which describe what type of image follows. This
header has undergone some revision, and this description is based on
the 1.02 version, which was the last known at the time of writing.

The most common X64 file you will see is the D64 variety, typically
174912 bytes long (174848 for the D64 and 64 bytes for the header,
assuming no error bytes are appended). The header layout (as used in
64COPY) is as follows:

00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
-----------------------------------------------
0000: 43 15 41 64 01 02 01 23 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0020: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0030: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0040: XX XX XX <- standard C64 image starts here....

Bytes          Description
$00-$03        This is the "Magic header" ($43 $15 $41 $64)
$04            Header version major ($01)
$05            Header version minor ($01, now its up to $02)
$06            Device type represented
$07            Maximum tracks in image (only in version 1.02 or greater)
1540/41/70: 35 1571: 35 1581: 80 (Logical single-sided
disk)
$08            Number of disk sides in image. This value must be $00 for
all 1541 and 1581 formats. $00=No second side $01=Second
side
$09            Error data flag.
$0A-$1F        Unused, set to $00
$20-$3E        Disk image description (in ASCII or ISO Latin/1)
$3F            Always set to $00
$40-           Standard C64 file begins here.

The device types are:

Value          Drive type
$00            1540 See note below...
$01            1541 (Default)
$02            1542
$03            1551
$04            1570
$05            1571
$06            1572
$08            1581
$10            2031 or 4031
$11            2040 or 3040
$12            2041
$18            4040
$20            8050
$21            8060
$22            8061
$30            SFD-1001
$31            8250
$32            8280

The first four bytes used for the device type at position $06 ($00
to $03) are functionally the same, and are compatible with older
version of X64 files. Some old X64 files might have $00 for the device
type (instead of $01), but it makes no real difference.

As most instances of X64 files will be strictly 1541 images, bytes
$08-$3F are set to zero, and some versions of the X64 emulator don't
use bytes $08-$3F.

15.5 The D71 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

Similar to the D64 (1541), the 1571 drive can operate in either
single-sided (1541 compatible) mode or double-sided (1571) mode. In
this section I will be dealing with the double-sided mode only. For the
breakdown of the single-sided mode, see the D64 section.

The D71 has 70 tracks, double that of the 1541, with a DOS file size
of 349696 bytes. If the error byte block (1366 bytes) is attached, this
makes the file size 351062 bytes. The track range and offsets into the
D71 files are as follows:

Track                                Sec/trk            # Sectors
1-17 (side 0)                        21                 357
18-24 (side 0)                       19                 133
25-30 (side 0)                       18                 108
31-35 (side 0)                       17                 85
36-52 (side 1)                       21                 357
53-59 (side 1)                       19                 133
60-65 (side 1)                       18                 108

The directory structure is the same as a D64/1541. All the same
filetypes apply, the directory still only holds 144 files per disk and
should only exist on track 18.

The first two bytes of the sector ($12/$04 or 18/4) indicate the
location of the next track/sector of the directory. If the track value
is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory. It is
possible, however unlikely, that the directory may *not* be competely
on track 18 (some disks do exist like this). Just follow the chain
anyhow.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The drive will return
all the available entries anyways. This is a breakdown of a standard
directory sector and entry:

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00/$FF
if its the last sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max. value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused (except with GEOS disks)
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx. filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE- replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange
results. The 1571 is inconsistent in how it treats these bits.  Some
routines use all 4 bits, others ignore bit 3, resulting in values from
0-7.

When the 1571 is in is native ("1571") mode, files are stored with a
sector interleave of 6, rather than 10 which the 1541 (and the 1571 in
"1541" mode) uses. The directory still uses an interleave of 3.

*** Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commodore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory
track where all filenames are stored. This limits the number of files
stored on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.
There are some disk images that contain more files than would normally
be allowed. This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive. However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non- extended part. Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is
on and assume the default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track
18 to track 19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few slots
on 19/6. When saving a new file, the drive DOS will find an empty file
slot at 19/6 offset $40 and correctly write the filename and a few
other things into this slot. When the file is done being saved the
final file information will be written to 18/6 offset $40 instead of
19/6 causing some directory corruption to the entry at 18/6. Also, the
BAM entries for the sectors occupied by the new file will not be saved
and the new file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing
off the directory track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could also
send the drive into an endless loop. The default directory track is
assumed for all sector reads when validating so if the directory goes
to 19/6, then the validate code will read 18/6 instead. If 18/6 is part
of the normal directory chain then the validate routine will loop
endlessly.

*** Bam layout The BAM is somewhat different as it now has to take
35 new tracks into account. In order to do this, most of the extra BAM
information is stored on track 53/0, and the remaining sectors on track
53 are marked in the BAM as allocated. This does mean that except for
one allocated sector on track 53, the rest of the track is unused and
wasted. (Track 53 is the equivalent to track 18, but on the flip side
of the disk). Here is a dump of the first BAM sector...

Bytes                                Description
$00-$01                              Track/Sector location of the first
directory sector (should be set to
18/1 but it doesn't matter, and
don't trust what is there, always
go to 18/1 for first directory
entry)
$02                                  Disk DOS version type (see note
below) $41 ('A') = 1541

$04-8F                               BAM entries for each track, in
groups of four bytes per track,
starting on track 1.
$90-$9F                              Disk Name (padded with $A0)
$A0-$A1                              Filled with $A0
$A2-$A3                              Disk ID
$A4                                  Usually $A0
$A5-$A6                              DOS type, usually "2A"
$A7-$AA                              Filled with $A0
$AB-$DC                              Not used ($00's)
$DD-$FF                              Free sector count for tracks 36-70
(1 byte/track).

The "free sector" entries for tracks 36-70 are likely included here
in the first BAM sector due to some memory restrictions in the 1571
drive. There is only enough memory available for one BAM sector, but in
order to generate the "blocks free" value at the end of a directory
listing, the drive needs to know the extra track "free sector" values.
It does make working with the BAM a little more difficult, though.

These are the values that would normally be with the 4-byte BAM
entry, but the rest of the entry is contained on 53/0.

Note: If the DOS version byte is set to anything other than $41 or
$00, then we have what is called "soft write protection". Any attempt
to write to the disk will return the "DOS Version" error code 73. The
1571 is simply telling you that it thinks the disk format version is
incorrect.

The BAM entries require some explanation. Take the first entry at
bytes $04-$07 ($12 $FF $F9 $17). The first byte ($12) is the number of
free sectors on that track. Since we are looking at the track 1 entry,
this means it has 18 (decimal) free sectors.

The next three bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are
used/free. Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 24 bits of
storage. Remember that at most, each track only has 21 sectors, so
there are a few unused bits. These entries must be viewed in binary to
make any sense. We will use the first entry (track 1) at bytes 04-07:

FF=11111111, F9=11111001, 17=00010111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222
01234567 89012345 67890123
--------------------------
11111111 10011111 11101000
^                     ^
sector 0           sector 20

Since we are on the first track, we have 21 sectors, and only use up
to the bit 20 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 has sectors 9,10 and 19 used, all the rest are free.

In order to complete the BAM, we must check 53/0.

Each track from 36-70 has 3 byte entries, starting at address $00.

Byte: $00-$02: $FF $FF $1F - BAM map for track 36
$03-$05: $FF $FF $1F - BAM map for track 37
...
$33-$35: $00 $00 $00 - BAM map for track 53
...
$66-$68: $FF $FF $01 - BAM map for track 70
$69-$FF:             - Not used

You can break down the entries for tracks 36-70 the same way as
track 1, just combine the free sector bytes from 18/0 and the BAM usage
from 53 to get the full 4-byte entry.

Just like a D64, you can attach error bytes to the file, for sector
error information. This block is 1366 bytes long, 1 byte for each of
the 1366 sectors in the image. With the error bytes, the file size is
351062 bytes.

15.6 The D81 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

Like D64 and D71, this is a byte for byte copy of a physical 1581
disk. It consists of 80 tracks, 40 sectors each (0 to 39) for a size of
819200 bytes, or 3200 sectors. If the error byte block is attached,
this makes the file size 822400 bytes.

There are three sectors on the directory track used for disk
internals (header and BAM), leaving 37 sectors for filename entries,
thus allowing for 296 files (37 * 8) to be stored at the root level of
the disk.

The actual physical layout on the disk is quite different from what
the user sees, but this is unimportant to the scope of this section.
One important difference from the D64 and D71 is all the sector
interleaves are now 1 for both files and directory storage (rather than
3 for directory and 10 for file on a D64/D71). This is due to the
built-in buffering in the 1581. When reading a sector, the whole track
will be buffered in memory, and any sectors being modified will be done
in memory. Once it has to be written, the whole track will be written
out in one step.

The track range and offsets into the D81 files are as follows:

Track              #Sect              #SectorsIn         D81 Offset
1                  40                 0                  $00000

The header sector is stored at 40/0, and contains the disk name, ID
and DOS version bytes, but the BAM is no longer contained here (like
the D64).

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of the first directory sector
(should be set to 40/3 but it doesn't matter, and don't
trust what is there, always go to 40/3 for first
directory entry)
$02            Disk DOS version type (see note below) $44 ('D')=1581
$03            $00
$04-$13        16 character Disk Name (padded with $A0)
$14-$15        $A0

$18            $A0
$19            DOS Version ("3")
$1A            Disk version ("D")
$1B-$1C        $A0
$1D-$FF        Unused (usually $00)

The following might be set if the disk is a GEOS format (this info
is based on the D64 layout, and might not prove to be true)

Bytes          Description
$AB-$AC        Border sector (GEOS only, else set to $00)
$AD-$BC        GEOS ID string ("geos FORMAT V1.x" GEOS only, else $00)
$BD-$FF        Unused (usually $00)

Note: If the DOS version byte is changed to anything other than a
$44 (or $00), then we have what is called "soft write protection". Any
attempt to write to the disk will return the "DOS Version" error code
73. The drive is simply telling you that it thinks the disk format
version is incompatible.

The directory track should be contained totally on track 40.
Sectors 3-39 contain the entries and sector 1 and 2 contain the BAM
(Block Availability Map). Sector 0 holds the disk name and ID. The
first directory sector is always 40/3, even though the t/s pointer at
40/0 (first two bytes) might point somewhere else. It goes linearly up
the sector count, 3-4-5-6-etc. Each sector holds up to eight entries.

The first two bytes of the sector ($28/$04) indicate the location of
the next track/sector of the directory (40/4). If the track is set to
$00, then it is the last sector of the directory. It is possible,
however unlikely, that the directory may *not* be competely on track
40. Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done (track=$00), the sector should contain an
$FF, meaning the whole sector is allocated. Theactual value doesn't
matter as all the entries will be returned anyways. Each directory
sector has the following layout:

Bytes          Description
$00-$1F        First directory entry

$A0-$BF        Sixth dir entry
$C0-$DF        Seventh dir entry
$E0-$FF        Eighth dir entry

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file or partition
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first SUPER SIDE SECTOR block
(REL file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only)
$18-$1B        Unused (except with GEOS disks)
$1C-$1D        (Used during an SAVE or OPEN, holds the new t/s link)
$1E-$1F        File or partition size in sectors, low/high byte order
($1E+$1F*256). The approx. file size in bytes is <=
#sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE- replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL
0101           5              CBM (partition or sub-directory)

Values 6-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange
results.

*** Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory
track where all filenames are stored. This limits the number of files
stored on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.
There are some disk images that contain more files than would normally
be allowed. This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive. However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is
on and assume the default directory track for operations.

*** BAM layout

The BAM is located on 40/1 (for side 0, tracks 1-40) and 40/2 (for
side 1, tracks 41-80). Each entry takes up six bytes, one for the "free
sector" count and five for the allocation bitmap.

$07: Auto-boot-loader flag
$08-$0F: Reserved for future (set to $00)
$10-$15: BAM entry for track 1 (track 41, side 1)
$16-$1B: BAM entry for track 2 (track 42, side 1)
...
$46-$4B: BAM entry for track 10 (track 50, side 1)

$82-$87: BAM entry for track 20 (track 60, side 1)
...
$BE-$C3: BAM entry for track 30 (track 70, side 1)
...
$FA-$FF: BAM entry for track 40 (track 80, side 1)

The BAM entries require some explanation, so lets look at the track
40 entry at bytes $FA-FF ($24 $F0 $FF $2D $FF $FE). The first byte
($24, or 36 decimal) is the number of free sectors on that track. The
next five bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are used/free.
Since it is five bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 40 bits of storage. Since
this format has 40 sectors/track, the whole five bytes are used.

F0: .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 24 F0 FF 2D FF FE

The last five bytes of any BAM entry must be viewed in binary to
make any sense. We will once again use track 40 as our reference:

F0=11110000, FF=11111111, 2D=00101101, FF=11111111, FE=11111110

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222 22222233 33333333
Sector 01234567 89012345 67890123 45678901 23456789
-------------------------- -------- --------
00001111 11111111 10110100 11111111 01111111

Note that if a bit is on (1), the sector is free. Therefore, track
40 has sectors 0-3, 17, 20, 22, 23 and 32 used, all the rest are free.

The second BAM (for side 1) contains the entries for tracks 41-80.

It is laid out exactly as the side 0 BAM except for one difference.
The track/sector reference for the next sector should be set to
$00/$FF, indicating there is no next sector.

*** REL files The REL filetype requires some extra explaining.  It
was designed to make access to data *anywhere* on the disk very fast.
Take a look at this directory entry...

00: 00 FF 84 27 00 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20
10: 49 4E 46 4F A0 27 02 FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 D2 0B

The third byte ($84) indicates this entry is a REL file and that the
three normally empty entries at offset $15, $16 and $17 are now used as
they are explained above. It's the track/sector chain that this entry
points to, called the SUPER SIDE SECTOR, which is of interest here (in
this case, 39/2).  The SUPER SIDE SECTOR is very different from the D64
format. If you check the D64 entry for a REL file and do the
calculations, you will find that the maximum file size of the REL file
is 720 data sectors. With the new SUPER SIDE SECTOR, you can now have
126 groups of these SIDE SECTORS chains, allowing for file sizes up to
(theoretically) 90720 sectors, or about 22.15 Megabytes.

Here is a dump of the beginning of the SUPER SIDE SECTOR...

00: 27 01 FE 27 01 15 09 03 0F 38 16 4A 1C 00 00 00
10: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
20: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Bytes:
$00-$01: Track/sector of first side sector in group 0
$02: Always $FE
$03-$04: Track/sector of first side sector in group 0 (again)
...
$FD-$FE: Track/sector of first side sector in group 125
$FF: Unused (likely $00)

The side sector layout is the same as the D64/1571.

Bytes:

$01: Sector location of next side-sector
$02: Side-sector block number (first sector is $00, the next is
$01, then $02, etc)
$03: REL file RECORD size (from directory entry)
$04-$0F: Track/sector locations of the six other side-sectors. Note
the first entry is this very sector we have listed here.
The next is the next t/s listed at the beginning of the
sector. All of this information must be correct. If one of
these chains is $00/$00, then we have no more side sectors.
Also, all of these (up to six) side sectors must have the
same values in this range.
$10-$FF: T/S chains of *each* sector of the data portion. When we
get a $00/$00, we are at the end of the file.

*** 1581 Partitions and Sub-directories

At the beginning of this section it was stated that the 1581 can
hold 296 entries "at the root level". The 1581 also has the ability to
partition areas of the disk. Under the right conditions these can
become sub-directories, acting as a small diskette, complete with its
own directory and BAM. When you are inside of a sub-directory, no other
files except those in that directory are visible, or can be affected.

To the 1581, this file will show up as a "CBM" filetype in a
directory. All this does is tell the disk that a file, starting at X/Y
track/sector and Z sectors large exists. Doing a validate will not harm
these files as they have a directory entry, and are fully allocated in
the BAM.

There are two main uses for partitions. One is to simply allocate a
section of the disk to be used for direct-access reads/writes, and lock
it away from being overwritten after a VALIDATE. The second is as a
sub-directory, basically a small "disk within a disk".

In order to use a partition as a sub-directory, it must adhere to
the following four rules:

1. If must start on sector 0
2. It's size must be in multiples of 40 sectors
3. It must be a minimum of 120 sectors long (3 tracks)
4. If must not start on or cross track 40, which limits the
biggest directory to 1600 sectors (tracks 1-39).

This is a dump of a sub-directory entry:

00: 00 FF 85 29 00 50 41 52 54 49 54 49 4F 4E 20 31
10: A0 A0 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 06

It is a partition starting on track 41/0, extends for 1600 sectors,
and has been formatted as a sub-directory. Note that when a partition
is created, the area being allocated is not touched in any way. If you
want it set up as a sub-directory, you must issue the FORMAT command to
the 1581 to create the central directory and BAM. Also note that from
the directory entry you can't tell whether it is a sub-directory or
not, just that it fits the sub-directory parameters.

The BAM track for the sub-directory exists on the first track of the
partition, and has the same layout as the disk BAM on track 40. The
biggest difference is the "disk name" is what what given when the
partition was formatted rather than what the actual disk name is. Also,
except for the free sectors in the partition area, all other sectors in
the BAM will be allocated.

If the partition size doesn't match the above rules for a
sub-directory, it will simply exist as a "protected" area of the disk,
and can't be used as a sub-directory. Either way, it still shows up as
a "CBM" type in a directory listing. Below is a dump of a 10-sector
partition starting on track 5/1, which does not qualify as a
sub-directory...

00: 00 00 85 05 01 53 4D 41 4C 4C 50 41 52 54 20 32
10: A0 A0 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0A 00

The master BAM shows the entry for this partition on track 5...

00: 28 02 44 BB 43 44 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
10: 23 C1 FF FF FF FF 28 FF FF FF FF FF 28 FF FF FF
20: FF FF 28 FF FF FF FF FF 1E 01 F8 FF FF FF 28 FF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The breakdown of the BAM shows the allocation for this track, with
sectors 1-10 allocated, as it should be.

10000000 00011111 11111111 11111111 11111111
^          ^          ^         ^          ^
0          10         20        30         39

Partitions and sub-directories share one very important trait.  When
created, the sub-directory entry simply has the starting track/sector
and the size of the partition in sectors.  Partitions are created
linearly, meaning if one starts on 30/1 and is of size 15 sectors, then
the sector range from 1 through 15 on track 30 will be allocated. If a
partition size crosses a track boundary, the allocation will continue
on the next track starting on sector 0, and going up.

The section allocated will *not* have a track/sector chain like a
file would, but rather is dependant on the directory entry to keep it
from being overwritten. You can store whatever you want to in the
allocated area.

*** AUTO-BOOT LOADER

If byte $07 in the BAM is set, then when the drive is reset (and
other circumstances) it will look for a USR file called "COPYRIGHT CBM
86". This file will then be loaded into the drive RAM and executed.

The format for this auto-loader file is fairly basic. It starts with
a two-byte load address, a size byte, program data, and a checksum at
the end.

Bytes:
$00-$01: Load address, low/high format
$02: Size of program (SZ) (smaller than 256 bytes)
$03-($03+SZ-1): Program data
$03+SZ: Checksum byte

15.7 The D80 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This is a sector-for-sector copy of an 8050 floppy disk. The file
size for an 8050 image is 533248 bytes. It is comprised of 256-byte
sectors arranged across 77 tracks, with a varying number of sectors per
track for a total of 2083 sectors. Track counting starts at 1 (not 0)
and sector counting starts at 0 (not 1), therefore a track with 29
sectors will go from 0 to 28.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in
circles, with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the
sides) to track 77 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the
inner hub ring). Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number
of sectors per track and data densities across the disk to optimize
available storage, resulting in the chart below. It shows the
sectors/track for a D80. Since the outside diameter of a circle is the
largest (versus closer to the center), the outside tracks have the
largest amount of storage.

Track Range              Sectors/track            # Sectors

The BAM (Block Availability Map) is on track 38. The D80 is only 77
tracks and so the BAM is contained on 38/0 and 38/3. The BAM interleave
is 3.

The directory is on track 39, with 39/0 contains the header (DOS
type, disk name, disk ID's) and sectors 1-28 contain the directory
entries. Both files and the directory use an interleave of 1. Since the
directory is only 28 sectors large (29 less one for the header), and
each sector can contain only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the
maximum number of directory entries is 28 * 8 = 224. The first
directory sector is always 39/1. It then follows a chain structure
using a sector interleave of 1 making the links go 39/1, 39/2, 39/3 etc.

When reading a disk, you start with 39/0 (disk label/ID) which
points to 38/0 (BAM0), 38/3 (BAM1), and finally to 39/1 (first dir
entry sector). When writing a file to a blank disk, it will start at
38/1 because 38/0 is already allocated.

Below is a dump of the header sector 39/0:

The first two bytes of the directory sector ($27/$02) indicate the
location of the next track/sector of the directory (39/2).  If the
track is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The drive will return
all the available entries anyways. This is a breakdown of a standard
directory sector:

Bytes          Description
$00-$1F        First directory entry
$20-$3F        Second dir entry
$40-$5F        Third dir entry
$60-$7F        Fourth dir entry
$80-$9F        Fifth dir entry
$A0-$BF        Sixth dir entry
$C0-$DF        Seventh dir entry
$E0-$FF        Eighth dir entry

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00 $00
if not the first entry in the sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max. value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx. filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254 0

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE- replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange
results.

*** Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory
track where all filenames are stored. This limits the number of files
stored on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.
There are some disk images that contain more files than would normally
be allowed. This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive. However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is
on and assume the default directory track for operations.

*** BAM layout

The BAM only occupies up to four sectors on track 38, so the rest of
the track is empty and is available for file storage.  Below is a dump
of the first BAM block, 38/0. A D80 will only contain two BAM sectors,
38/0 and 38/3. Each entry takes 5 bytes, 1 for the free count on that
track, and 4 for the BAM bits.

$06-$0A                BAM for track 1. The first byte shows the "blocks
free" for this track, the remaining 4 show the
BAM for the track.
$0B-$0F                BAM for track 2
...                    ...
$FB-$FF                BAM for track 50

Being bit-based, the BAM entries need some explanation. The first
track entry in the above BAM sector is at offset 06, "1D FF FF FF 1F".
The first number is how many blocks are free on this track ($1D=29) and
the remainder is the bit representation of the usage map for the track.
These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense. First convert
the values to binary:

FF=11111111, FF=11111111, FF=11111111, 1F=00011111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222 222222
01234567 89012345 67890123 456789...
-------------------------- ---------
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
^                              ^
sector 0                   sector 28

Since we are on the first track, we have 29 sectors, and only use up
to the bit 28 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 is clean, all sectors are free.  Any leftover bits
that refer to sectors that don't exist, like bits 29-31 in the above
example, are set to allocated.

Second BAM block 38/3.

15.8 The D82 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This is a sector-for-sector copy of an 8250 floppy disk. The file
size for an 8250 image is 1066496 bytes. It is comprised of 256-byte
sectors arranged across 154 tracks, with a varying number of sectors
per track for a total of 4166 sectors. Track counting starts at 1 (not
0) and sector counting starts at 0 (not 1), therefore a track with 29
sectors will go from 0 to 28.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in
circles, with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the
sides) to track 77 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the
inner hub ring). Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number
of sectors per track and data densities across the disk to optimize
available storage, resulting in the chart below. It shows the
sectors/track for a D82. Since the outside diameter of a circle is the
largest (versus closer to the center), the outside tracks have the
largest amount of storage.

The BAM (Block Availability Map) is on track 38. The D82 is 154
tracks and so the BAM is contained on 38/0, 38/3, 38/6 and 38/9.  The
BAM interleave is 3.

The directory is on track 39, with 39/0 contains the header (DOS
type, disk name, disk ID's) and sectors 1-28 contain the directory
entries. Both files and the directory use an interleave of 1. Since the
directory is only 28 sectors large (29 less one for the header), and
each sector can contain only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the
maximum number of directory entries is 28 * 8 = 224. The first
directory sector is always 39/1. It then follows a chain structure
using a sector interleave of 1 making the links go 39/1, 39/2, 39/3 etc.

When reading a disk, you start with 39/0 (disk label/ID) which
points to 38/0 (BAM0), 38/3 (BAM1), 38/6 (BAM2), 38/9 (BAM3, and
finally to 39/1 (first dir entry sector). When writing a file to a
blank disk, it will start at 38/1 because 38/0 is already allocated.

Below is a dump of the header sector 39/0:

The first two bytes of the directory sector ($27/$02) indicate the
location of the next track/sector of the directory (39/2).  If the
track is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The drive will return
all the available entries anyways. This is a breakdown of a standard
directory sector:

Bytes          Description
$00-$1F        First directory entry
$20-$3F        Second dir entry
$40-$5F        Third dir entry
$60-$7F        Fourth dir entry
$80-$9F        Fifth dir entry
$A0-$BF        Sixth dir entry
$C0-$DF        Seventh dir entry
$E0-$FF        Eighth dir entry

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00 $00
if not the first entry in the sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max. value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx. filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254 0

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE- replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange
results.

*** Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory
track where all filenames are stored. This limits the number of files
stored on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.
There are some disk images that contain more files than would normally
be allowed. This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive. However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is
on and assume the default directory track for operations.

*** BAM layout

The BAM only occupies up to four sectors on track 38, so the rest of
the track is empty and is available for file storage.  Below is a dump
of the first BAM block, 38/0. A D82 will contain four BAM sectors,
38/0, 38/3, 38/6 and 38/9. Each entry takes 5 bytes, 1 for the free
count on that track, and 4 for the BAM bits.

$05                    Highest+1 track covered by this BAM (0x33=51)
$06-$0A                BAM for track 1. The first byte shows the "blocks
free" for this track, the remaining 4 show the
BAM for the track.
$0B-$0F                BAM for track 2
...                    ...
$FB-$FF                BAM for track 50

Being bit-based, the BAM entries need some explanation. The first
track entry in the above BAM sector is at offset 06, "1D FF FF FF 1F".
The first number is how many blocks are free on this track ($1D=29) and
the remainder is the bit representation of the usage map for the track.
These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense. First convert
the values to binary:

FF=11111111, FF=11111111, FF=11111111, 1F=00011111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222 222222
01234567 89012345 67890123 456789...
-------------------------- ---------
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
^                              ^
sector 0                  sector 28

Since we are on the first track, we have 29 sectors, and only use up
to the bit 28 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 is clean, all sectors are free. Any leftover bits
that refer to sectors that don't exist, like bits 29-31 in the above
example, are set to allocated.

15.9 The P00 image format
=========================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

These files were created for use in the PC64 emulator, written by
Wolfgang Lorenz. Each one has the same layout with the filetype being
stored in the DOS extension (i.e. Pxx is a PRG, Sxx is a SEQ, Uxx is a
USR and Rxx is a RELative file), and the header is only 26 bytes long.

This is a dump of a Pxx file (PRG)...

00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
-----------------------------------------------
0000: 43 36 34 46 69 6C 65 00 43 52 49 53 49 53 20 4D
0010: 4F 55 4E 54 41 49 4E 00 00 00

Bytes                  Description
$00-$06                ASCII string "C64File"
$07                    Always $00
$08-$17                Filename in PETASCII, padded with $00 (not $A0,
like a D64)
$18                    Always $00
$19                    REL file record size ($00 if not a REL file)
$1A-??                 Program data

The 'xx' in the extension of the file is usually 00, except when we
have two DOS filenames which would be the same, but the C64 filenames
are different! If we have two C64 filenames which are the same, they
*cannot* co-exist in the same directory. If we have two files which do
convert down to be the same DOS filename, the extension is incremented
until an unused one is found (x01, x02, x03, up to x99). We can have up
to 99 different C64 files with the same corresponding DOS names as
that's all the extension will hold (from P00 to P99).

Each PC64 file only has one entry, there are no multi-file
containers allowed. This could result in a large number of these files
in a directory, even for only a few programs, as each C64 file will
result in a PC64 file entry. The best use for a PC64 file is a
single-file program, one which does not load anything else.

18 Contact information
**********************

18.1 VICE home page
===================

You can find the latest news about VICE at the official VICE home page:

http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/

VICE has moved its source repository to public services provided by
SourceForge. You can find it at
http://sf.net/projects/vice-emu.

We would like to thank the SourceForge staff for that help.

If you are going to report a bug, please check those pages _first_;
it is possible that the problem you encountered has already been fixed
with a newer version.

Please, also have a look at the VICE knowledge base at

http://vicekb.trikaliotis.net/

18.2 How to send feedback
=========================

Before contacting us, have a look at the VICE knowledge base at
http://vicekb.trikaliotis.net/ if your question is answered there. Keep
in mind that we work on VICE in our spare-time, so the more time we
don't need to answer the same questions over and over again, the more
time we have to improve the emulation itself. On the other hand, that
does not mean that you should not contact us, especially if you find
bugs or have suggestions which might improve the emulation.

Bug reports, suggestions, support requests should be directed to the
SourceForge trackers at

* http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=223021.

This way, you, the users, and we, the developers, can track what has
been reported and what has been already fixed. Ideally, also sent the
report to the mailing address of the Vice team at

* VICE Mailing List (<vice-emu-mail@lists.sourceforge.net>) for all
general questions, bug reports, suggestions.


You can also contact (some of) us on IRC, at #vice-dev on freenode.

It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE,
but please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the
team.

* Please put the word `VICE' _in all capitals_ in your subject line
(e.g., `VICE fails to run game XXX').  This helps mail splitting
and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally deleted,
forgotten or lost.

* Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you use
M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off the
"rich text" (HTML) feature.

* Please don't send _any_ binaries without asking first.

* Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a
bug or a problem you cannot solve:

* the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);

* the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable
from the VICE home page: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/);

* The VICE knowledge base (it is available on the Internet at
http://vicekb.trikaliotis.net/);

* the `comp.emulators.cbm' and `comp.sys.cbm' FAQs (*note FAQs
you should read::).

* When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should
also tell us what machine you are running on, what operating
system you are using as well as the version of it.

* Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to
your PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.  To
transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander
(http://sta.c64.org/sc.html) on DOS, and OpenCBM
(http://www.trikaliotis.net/opencbm) on Windows and Linux.  And
no, you cannot read C64 disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

* Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
Internet.

* Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
really don't know.

* Please write in English.


In any case, we would be _really_ glad to receive your comments
about VICE.  We cannot always answer all the email, but we surely read
all of it.

Thanks!

18.3 How to contribute
======================

If you want to make a major contribution, please _ask_ first.  It has
already happened a couple of times that somebody started working at
something that had already been done but not released to the public yet,
and we really do _not_ want anybody to waste time.

If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is
relative to the very latest version, and provide us with the following:

* Make sure you are giving us a diff against the latest Subversion
trunk version of VICE. For instructions on accessing the Subversion
repository, first read http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=223021
and get it with the command:
`svn co https://vice-emu.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vice-emu/trunk vice-src'

* send a unified diff file against the trunk version of VICE (see
above bullet point) by using the command: `svn diff' inside of the
SVN workspace you checked out before.

* If you cannot use SVN for one or the other reason, send a unified
diff file containing all the changes you have made `diff -u';
please don't use plain `diff'), as it adds much work for us to get
it working;

* GNU-style `ChangeLog' entries with a description of the changes you
have made (look at the `ChangeLog's provided with the original VICE
sources for an example).

This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother and
safer.

People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always welcome.
But notice from experience it will take at least a full year of
continuous work to write a well working and stable port.

18.4 Interesting newsgroups
===========================

There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:

* `comp.emulators.cbm', discussing about emulators of Commodore 8-bit
machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

* `comp.sys.cbm', discussing various topics regarding real Commodore
8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people who actually
use original Commodore equipment (so please don't talk about
emulation here).

* `comp.emulators.misc', discussing emulators in general.


18.5 FAQs you should read
=========================

We recommend reading the `comp.emulators.cbm' and `comp.sys.cbm' FAQs,
which are posted regularly on the corresponding newsgroups and are also
available via FTP from ftp://rtfm.mit.edu.
