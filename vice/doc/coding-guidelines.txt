VICE project coding guidelines
==============================

This document is intended to set some guidelines for people wanting to
contribute code to the VICE project.

There are two distinct parts to the VICE source code, the architecture code
parts which are located in src/arch, and the common code parts which are
located everywhere in src except in src/arch.

The architecture code parts are in their own respective directories and *may*
have their own coding style, however try to stick to these guidelines at least
for C code, if possible.

The common code however is used by all supported architectures and therefor
needs to be as portable as possible. To achieve this portability some
guidelines have to be followed.

Project Folders Hierarchy Descriptions
--------------------------------------
Here are short descriptions of the project code folders and their functions:

src/           - common code
 arch          - architecture specific code for various platforms (win, unix, amigaos, etc)

Cosmetic guidelines for all code
--------------------------------

To keep the code easy to follow please read the following statements:

- Use the types in <stdint.h> for fixed-width types, so `uint8_t` rather than
  `BYTE`, `uint16_t` for `WORD` and `uint32_t` for `DWORD`.

- Generally put the opening brace of a block at the end of the line ("cuddling"
  braces style), except at the beginning of a function, ie:
  
  void foo(int bar)
  {
      if (bar) {
          /* ... */
      }
  }
  
- No variable declarations after the first line of code, some compilers
  just can't handle it.

  New block-level declarations are fine:

    if (foo) {
        int bar = 0;
        /* code using bar */
    }

  Perfectly valid even in C89, if a compiler can't handle this, get a proper
  compiler.

- Don't use mixtures of tabs and spaces as indentation, using 4 spaces per
  level will make the code look the same no matter what editor you use.
  When changing an existing file, make sure the indentation style is the
  same throughout the source file.

- For 'if' and 'for' always use braces.
  examples:

    if (foo) {
        ...
    }

    if (foo) {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
        ...
    }

- A keyword should be followed by a space, so:
    if (foo == 0) { ... }
  not
    if(foo == 0) { ... }

  Exception: the sizeof operator, using sizeof as a "function" on a type should
             not use spaces, ie: sizeof(int), however using sizeof on an object
             should use spaces (ie: int *i; sizeof *i)

- Binary operators: use spaces around binary operators:
    int i = 1 + 2;
    unsigned int i <<= 3;

  But please don't use them with when accessing members of an object:
    foo->bar, not foo -> bar.

- Unary operators:
  Don't use spaces when using unary operators:
    ~0 is fine,
    ~ 0 isn't.

- Use boolean logic only when the context is clear and the thing tested can
  actually be considered boolean:

  Basically:
    `if (!strcmp(a b))` is WRONG since strcmp() returns three different values,
    0 when equal (which is what the ! tests against), < 0 when a < b, and
    > 0 when b > a.
    So please use `if (strcmp(a, b) == 0)`, a little more typing, but much more
    clear.

    We also seem to have a lot of functions returning either 0 on success, or
    -1 on error. And a lot of code using boolean logic on the return value.
    Please don't. Unfortunately this is so wide spread in the VICE code it's
    hard to fix.

- Use braces even when they are not really required, it makes expressions
  easier to read and allows to use advanced highlighting in the editor, ie
  
  if ((a + b) && (c != d)) {
      /* ... */
  }
  
    instead of 
    
  if (a + b && c != d) {
      /* ... */
  }

- No 'clever' while/do trickery, unless required for preprocessor code. The
  following looks clever:

    while (*s++ != '\0');

  But this is clearer and will generate the same object code:

    while (*s != '\0') {
        s++;
    }

- To give the code a consistent look use specifiers named with prefixes
  like in the following examples:

    struct foobar_s {
        ...
    };

    typedef ... foobar_t;

    enum stuff_e {
        ...
    };

    union many_u {
        ...
    };

  Of course combinations may be used:

    typedef struct foobar_s {
        ...
    } foobar_t;

  Exceptions are basic type like BYTE, WORD, DWORD and code that follows a
  coding style of a certain architecture, e.g. UI code.

- Preprocessor macros which define constants or enumeration values should
  be written in capital letters.

   #define FORTYTWO 42

   typedef numbers_e {
       NUM_ZERO,
       NUM_ONE
   } numbers_t;

Common code guidelines
----------------------

Many different compilers are used to compile the common code parts.

- When using headers which are tested for in configure.proto don't assume they
  exist, use the #ifdef HAVE_*_H instead.

- Don't use C++ style comments (// comment), use C-style comments instead
  (/* comment */). This goes for C99 code as well.

- When adding header files use VICE_*_H as shown in the following example:

#ifndef VICE_RS232_H
#define VICE_RS232_H

...code...

#endif

- Refrain from using any non ASCII characters in source files, unless absolutely
  necessary. Previously a common trap were copyright headers - make sure to
  use latin letters only to write your name etc. or in other words: such chars
  should not be used anywhere, except in a few selected (usually translation
  related) files that contain tables of strings.
  The reason for this is that various tools get confused or even choke on any-
  thing that isnt the encoding they expect (and plain ascii always works). It
  also ensures that all files can be edited by anyone at any time without intro-
  ducing weird side effects.
  On a *nix system you may use the "file" command to check the files you
  changed, normally it should always say "ASCII text" (not ISO-8859, and
  definately not UTF-8 Unicode).

current exceptions from this rule are:

src/infocontrib.h:                 ISO-8859                     (generated file)

src/translate_text.c:              ISO-8859                        (translation)
src/translate_text.c.po.c:         ISO-8859             (translation, generated)

src/arch/amigaos/intl.c:           ISO-8859                        (translation)
src/arch/amigaos/intl_text.c:      ISO-8859                        (translation)
src/arch/amigaos/intl_text.c.po.c: ISO-8859             (translation, generated)

src/arch/win32/res*.rc.po.c:       ISO-8859             (translation, generated)

src/arch/win32/vs_tmpl/mkmsvc.c:   UTF-8 Unicode, CRLF line terminators

Keep in mind that editing the translation related files need special care, make
sure not to mess up the file by somehow converting the encoding!


Adding new files to the svn repo

svn:mime-type   text/plain

When adding a non-text file use only the correct mime-type.

For all other files use the following svn properties:
