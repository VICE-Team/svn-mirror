VICE project coding guidelines
==============================

This document is intended to set some guidelines for people wanting to
contribute code to the VICE project.

There are two distinct parts to the VICE source code, the architecture code
parts which are located in src/arch, and the common code parts which are
located everywhere in src except in src/arch.

The common code is used by all supported architectures and therefor needs to be
as portable as possible.

To achieve this portability, and to keep the codebase tidy and clean, some
guidelines have to be followed.

Project Folders Hierarchy Descriptions
--------------------------------------

Here are short descriptions of the project code folders and their functions:

generally:

- All code in the root of the tree is common code that contains no architecture
  specific parts.

- 3rd party libraries and headers which have been pulled into the sourcetree
  live in src/lib/ . Files in this directory tree do not have to follow the
  codestyle lined out here, as they could be replaced/updated at any time.

- Architecture specific code lives in src/arch/shared.

- Code that is specific to a (G)UI should live in src/arch/<gui>.

Cosmetic guidelines for all code
--------------------------------

To keep the code tidy and easy to follow please read the following statements:


- Don't use C++ style comments in C code (// comment), use C-style comments
  instead (/* comment */). This goes for C99 code as well.

  You may use the ./checkstyle.sh script to find dangling c++ comments:

  $ ./checkstyle.sh comments

- We strictly indent by 4 spaces. Don't use mixtures of tabs and spaces as
  indentation, using 4 spaces per level will make the code look the same no
  matter what editor you use.

  You may use the checkstyle.sh script to find dangling tabs:

  $ ./checkstyle.sh tabs

- Avoid trailing whitespace. Many editors can show this and remove this.

  You may use the checkstyle.sh script to find trailing whitespace:

  $ ./checkstyle.sh whitespace

- Refrain from using any non ASCII characters in source files, unless absolutely
  necessary. Previously a common trap were copyright headers - make sure to
  use latin letters only to write your name etc. or in other words: such chars
  should not be used anywhere, except in a few selected (usually translation
  related) files that contain tables of strings.
  The reason for this is that various tools get confused or even choke on any-
  thing that isnt the encoding they expect (and plain ascii always works). It
  also ensures that all files can be edited by anyone at any time without intro-
  ducing weird side effects.
  On a *nix system you may use the "file" command to check the files you
  changed, normally it should always say "ASCII text" (not ISO-8859, and
  definately not UTF-8 Unicode).

  current exceptions from this rule are:

  src/infocontrib.h: ISO-8859 (generated file)

  Keep in mind that editing the translation related files need special care,
  make sure not to mess up the file by somehow converting the encoding!

  You may use the findhacks.sh script in src/ to check all sourcefiles and find
  any that contain non ascii characters:

  $ ./findhacks.sh encoding

- Use the types in <stdint.h> for fixed-width types, so `uint8_t` rather than
  `BYTE`, `uint16_t` for `WORD` and `uint32_t` for `DWORD`.

- Generally put the opening brace of a block at the end of the line ("cuddling"
  braces style), except at the beginning of a function, ie:

  void foo(int bar)
  {
      if (bar) {
          /* ... */
      }
  }


- No variable declarations after the first line of code, some compilers
  just can't handle it.


- One variable declaration per line, and especially don't mix plain types with
  pointers.

  Don't do this:

    int foo, bar, *huppel;

  Do this:
    int foo;
    int bar;
    int *huppel;

  Might look short and clever, but as soon as you want to change a single type,
  you'll either screw them all up, or have to split them anyway. Just don't.


  New block-level declarations are fine:

    if (foo) {
        int bar = 0;
        /* code using bar */
    }

  Perfectly valid even in C89, if a compiler can't handle this, get a proper
  compiler.

- For 'if' and 'for' always use braces.
  examples:

    if (foo) {
        ...
    }

    if (foo) {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
        ...
    }

- A keyword should be followed by a space, so:
    if (foo == 0) { ... }
  not
    if(foo == 0) { ... }

  Exception: the sizeof operator, using sizeof as a "function" on a type should
             not use spaces, ie: sizeof(int), however using sizeof on an object
             should use spaces (ie: int *i; sizeof *i)

- Binary operators: use spaces around binary operators:
    int i = 1 + 2;
    unsigned int i <<= 3;

  But please don't use them with when accessing members of an object:
    foo->bar, not foo -> bar.

- Unary operators:
  Don't use spaces when using unary operators:
    ~0 is fine,
    ~ 0 isn't.

- Use boolean logic only when the context is clear and the thing tested can
  actually be considered boolean:

  Basically:
    `if (!strcmp(a b))` is WRONG since strcmp() returns three different values,
    0 when equal (which is what the ! tests against), < 0 when a < b, and
    > 0 when b > a.
    So please use `if (strcmp(a, b) == 0)`, a little more typing, but much more
    clear.

    We also seem to have a lot of functions returning either 0 on success, or
    -1 on error. And a lot of code using boolean logic on the return value.
    Please don't. Unfortunately this is so wide spread in the VICE code it's
    hard to fix.

- Use braces even when they are not really required, it makes expressions
  easier to read and allows to use advanced highlighting in the editor, ie

  if ((a + b) && (c != d)) {
      /* ... */
  }

    instead of

  if (a + b && c != d) {
      /* ... */
  }

- No 'clever' while/do trickery, unless required for preprocessor code. The
  following looks clever:

    while (*s++ != '\0');

  But this is clearer and will generate the same object code:

    while (*s != '\0') {
        s++;
    }

- To give the code a consistent look use specifiers named with prefixes
  like in the following examples:

    struct foobar_s {
        ...
    };

    typedef ... foobar_t;

    enum stuff_e {
        ...
    };

    union many_u {
        ...
    };

  Of course combinations may be used:

    typedef struct foobar_s {
        ...
    } foobar_t;

  Exceptions are basic type like BYTE, WORD, DWORD and code that follows a
  coding style of a certain architecture, e.g. UI code.

- Preprocessor macros which define constants or enumeration values should
  be written in capital letters.

   #define FORTYTWO 42

   typedef numbers_e {
       NUM_ZERO,
       NUM_ONE
   } numbers_t;


Symbols in ifdefs
-----------------

- If tests for a certain (G)UI are needed, they can use the following symbols.
  No other symbols should be defined to "shortcut" certain combinations!

  USE_SDLUI
  USE_SDL2UI
  USE_GTK3UI
  USE_HEADLESSUI

  Remember this kind of tests should ideally not occur anywhere in common code -
  but if they can not be avoided, they should always come with a comment that
  tells why this test exists.

- For tests for a certain architecture/operating system the build system defines
  some symbols. No other symbols should be used for this, in particular not the
  various things defined by compilers or system libraries. Eg do not use
  "_WIN32" when you need to check for "is this windows?", use "WINDOWS_COMPILE"
  instead.

  The architecture symbols are nested in a hierarchic way:

  WINDOWS_COMPILE           - compiling for windows (32bit AND 64bit)
    WIN64_COMPILE           - compiling for 64bit windows
  UNIX_COMPILE              - any *nix system
    LINUX_COMPILE
    MACOS_COMPILE
    BSD_COMPILE
      FREEBSD_COMPILE
      DRAGONFLYBSD_COMPILE
      NETBSD_COMPILE
      OPENBSD_COMPILE
  BEOS_COMPILE
  HAIKU_COMPILE

  Remember this kind of tests should ideally not occur anywhere in common code -
  but if they can not be avoided, they should always come with a comment that
  tells why this test exists.

- When using headers which are tested for in configure.proto don't assume they
  exist, use the #ifdef HAVE_*_H instead.

   #ifdef HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H
   #include <sys/types.h>
   #endif

  you can look at src/config.h to see which symbols are available

- When adding header files use VICE_*_H as shown in the following example:

   #ifndef VICE_RS232_H
   #define VICE_RS232_H

   ...code...

   #endif


Common code guidelines
----------------------

Many different compilers may be used to compile the common code parts, although
in practise this will be either GCC or MSVC.

- There should be no compiler specific hacks anywhere and no ifdefs checking
  for specific compilers. The only exception to this rule is the global vice.h.
  The same is true for CPU/Arch specific checks.

  There are still some of these compiler specific hacks dangling around, all of
  which are subject for removal. Do not add any new ones :)

  You can find such things using ./src/findhacks.sh ccarchdep

- Generally no arch specific hacks and ifdefs should be present in common code.
  All arch specific code should be abstracted into functions which then live in
  src/arch/shared. Code that is specific to a GUI should live in src/arch/<gui>.

  When a platform specific ifdef can not be avoided in common code, it should
  always come with a comment that explains why exactly that ifdef exists and
  what the respective portion of code is supposed to do.

  Since this rule did not exist in the past, there is still a lot of arch 
  specific code around elsewhere that needs to be moved - this is no excuse for
  ignoring the rule when writing new code however.

  You can find such thing using: ./src/findhacks.sh archdep


Documentation
-------------

Please add documentation to code you add or alter.

We use Doxygen to document our code, add docblocks for each public function or
data structure, at a minimum. Adding documentation is boring and the discipline
to do that is even harder, but it'll help out your fellow (future) devs and
probably even you after not working on a piece of code for some time. (Also
see Doxygen-Howto.txt)

This also applies to the user manual - when you are adding new features, please
document it in vice.texi (see Documentation-Howto.txt)


Adding new files to the svn repo
--------------------------------

When adding a *nix script file use the following svn properties:

svn:eol-style   LF
svn:mime-type   text/plain
svn:executable  *

When adding a windows/dos batch file use the following svn properties:

svn:eol-style   CRLF
svn:mime-type   text/plain
svn:executable  *

When adding a non-text file use only the correct mime-type.

For all other files use the following svn properties:

svn:eol-style   native
svn:mime-type   text/plain
