0 Introduction
--------------

This version of VICE contains national language support (NLS) using
the GNU (or OS-supplied) gettext library. gettext eases the handling
of translations of (usually English) output messages to other
languages by introducing the concept of message catalogs.

Message catalogs can exist in various formats. The human-readable and
-editable format is the PO file format. These human-readable files are
then translated to MO files which can be used by the gettext library.

Please refer to the (quite good) GNU gettext documentation for further
details. Read it with info ('info gettext'), or go online to 
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html


1 Compiling VICE with localized messages
----------------------------------------

VICE is compiled by default with NLS enabled. If you don't want
NLS invoke configure with the option

./configure --disable-nls

If you don't know how to compile VICE, please read the INSTALL file.


2 Changing language settings
----------------------------

In general most modern (Linux-) distributions add support for choosing
the language at login time or for the actual session.

However to enable vice internationalization support without changing
the language for all other applications you can try to set the
appropriate environment variables (see below). To choose the
appropriate language check the alias in 
  /usr/share/locale/locale.alias

There you'll find  "german", "swedish", "polish" and "italian"; the full
featured translations ("french" is a bit dated and currently not well
supported! Any volunteer?)

so try
  LC_ALL=german ; export LC_ALL 
to get a german UI for Vice.

Make sure you have the proper language support package
installed. There you usually find the necessary fonts, etc. Check your
distro's manuals if you don't know what I'm speaking of.

Older (Linux-)distributions (based on older C-libs) sometimes use other
variables to set the language. 
Try this:
  You have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
  language code before running VICE. ISO 639 language codes can be found
  in the gettext manual.
  
  For example, if you speak Swedish, just type `export LANG=sv' at the 
  BASH prompt. This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, 
  once and for all.
  
  If this doesn't work on your system (e.g. you get messages like this:
    `locale not supported by C library'
  try to set the environment variable `LANGUAGE' or `LC_MESSAGES' to the
  values described above.
  
3 Adding new messages
---------------------

1. Edit the ALL_LINGUAS line in 'configure.in' and add your
   language code. In this example we will use Italian, so we
   will add "it":

   ALL_LINGUAS="de sv fr it"
                        ^^^^
   As I said earlier, ISO 639 language codes can be found in
   the gettext manual.

2. Execute 'autoconf' to create a new 'configure' script.

3. Now issue './configure'.

4. Go to the 'po' subdirectory.

5. Do a 'cp vice.pot it.po'. 'vice.pot' is is the common ground 
   for the translation teams to produce one PO for their language.
   'it.po' is the new translation file for your language. The part
   before the dot is your language code.

6. Now use the editor of your choice to provide translations in
   'it.po'. There is an emacs major mode (po-mode) that eases this
   process. Please also read paragraph 5!

7. Now issue 'make'. This causes an 'it.gmo' to be created. It is the
   file that will be used by the gettext library.

8. Do a 'make install' to install 'it.gmo' to the appropriate directory.


4 Updating messages
-------------------

VICE messages change at every release. Go to the 'po' subdirectory and 
do a 'make update-po'. This updates all existing PO-files (removing 
obsolete translations, providing new, empty entries). Check the PO file
for your language and provide translations for the new, empty entries.


5 Notes on translating messages
-------------------------------

A leading '*' is a hint for the menu generator to generate a
checkbox. In your translation just leave the '*' in the beginning:

#: src/arch/unix/c128ui.c:78 src/arch/unix/uicrtc.c:58
#: src/arch/unix/uisettings.c:1195 src/arch/unix/uisettings.c:1215
msgid "*Double size"
msgstr "*Doppelte GröÂße"

C format strings must be saved within the translation otherwhise
the program might fail.

The example below tries to print a number (%d) and then a string
(%s). Your translation must also adhere this sequence (%d before
%s), otherwhise strange things (even a crash) might happen.

#: src/arch/unix/archdep.c:233
#, c-format
msgid "Received signal %d (%s)."
msgstr "Signal %d (%s) empfangen."

Luckily those situations are rare within Vice.

BTW, the `c-format' above indicates that a C-format string is
contained in the to-be-translated msgid.
 
Other format specifiers (\n, etc.) are used for print formatting,
and are not strictly required. It depends on the language what is
nicely formatted and what is not.
