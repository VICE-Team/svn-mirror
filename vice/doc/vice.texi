Copyright @copyright{} 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  675
Mass Ave, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
@end display

@unnumberedsec Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@iftex
@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end ifinfo

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

@unnumberedsec How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@smallexample
@var{one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.}
Copyright (C) 19@var{yy}  @var{name of author}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
@end smallexample

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

@smallexample
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19@var{yy} @var{name of author}
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.
@end smallexample

The hypothetical commands @samp{show w} and @samp{show c} should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @samp{show w} and
@samp{show c}; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items---whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

@example
@group
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

@var{signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
@end group
@end example

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

@node Preface, Usage, License, Top
@chapter About VICE

VICE is the one and only @dfn{Versatile Commodore Emulator}.  It allows
you to emulate the Commodore 64, 128, VIC20 and PET 8-bit computers with
one single package.  The emulators run as separate programs, but have
the same user interface, share the same settings and support the same
file formats.

@strong{Important notice:} If you have no idea about what a Commodore
8-bit computer is, or have questions about how these machines are used,
how the file formats work or everything else that is not strictly
related to VICE, you should read the appropriate FAQs @emph{first}, as
this kind of information is not available here.  @xref{Contacts} for
information about how to retrieve the the FAQs.

All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with emulation
of all the opcodes (both documented and undocumented ones) and accurate
timing.  Unlike other emulators, the emulation of all the chips is cycle
accurate, and tries to emulate timings as precisely as possible while
trying to use as little processor power as possible.

Please do @emph{not} expect the VIC20, C128 and PET emulators to be as
good as the C64 one, as they are still under construction.

@section C64 emulator features

The C64 emulator, called @samp{x64}, features a fairly complete
emulation of the VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and all video
modes are fully emulated.  Since version 0.13.0, the emulation is fully
cycle-accurate.

Moreover, a rather complete emulation of the SID sound chip is provided.
All the basic features are implemented as well as most of the complex
ones including sync, ring modulation and filters.

Of course, also both CIAs are cycle-accurate and fully emulated.

@section VIC20 emulator features

The VIC20 emulates all the internal hardware, including the VIA chips.
Only part of the VIC-I video chip features are emulated, so some
graphical effects will not work correctly.

Sound is implemented, but is still at the experimental stage.  If
you think it does not sound right and know how to improve it, feel
free to contact us (@pxref{Contacts}).


@node PET emulator features, CBM-II emulator features, VIC20 emulator features, Preface
@section PET emulator features

The PET emulator emulates the 2001, 3032, 4032, 8032, 8096, 8296 and SuperPET
(MicroMainFram 9000) models, which almost covers all models of this kind of 
machines.  The
hardware is pretty much the same and that is why one single program is
enough to emulate all of them.  For more detailed information about PET
hardware please refer to the @file{PETdoc} file.
@c FIXME: link!

Both the 40 column and 80 column CRTC video chips are emulated (from the
4032 onward), but a few of the features are not implemented yet (numbers
of rasterlines per char and lines per screen).  Anyway, those missing
features are not very important for average applications.

Sound is available for the PET as well, but like the VIC20 it is still
under construction.

The PET 8096 is basically a PET 8032 with a 64k extension board, that
allows remapping the upper 32k with RAM.  You have to write to a special
register at @code{$fff0} to remap the memory.  The PET 8296 is a
8096 but with a completely redesigned motherboard with 128k RAM in
total.  Of the additional 32k RAM you can use only some in blocks of 4k,
but you have to set jumpers on the motherboard for it.  VICE uses the
command line options @samp{petram9} and @samp{-petramA}
instead.  Also the video controller can handle a larger address range.
The PET 8x96 model emulations run the Commodore LOS-96 operating system
- basically an improved BASIC 4 version with up to 32k for BASIC
text and 32k for variables.  See @file{PETdoc} for more information.
@c FIXME link!

The SuperPET also is a PET 8032 with an expansion board. It can map
4k at a time out of 64k into the @code{$9***} area. Also it has an 
ACIA 6551 for RS232 communication.

The PET computers came with three major ROM revisions, so-called BASIC
1, 2 and 4, all of which are provided.  The PET 2001 uses the version 1,
the PET 3032 uses version 2, and the others use version 4.  The 2001 ROM
is horribly broken in the IEEE488 part (they shipped it before they
tested it with the floppy drive, so only tape worked - which is not
supported in this emulator) so the ROM is patched to fix the IEEE488
routines.

What the 2001 patch basically does is (amongst more low level fixes)
get the load address for a program file from the first two
bytes of the file.  This allows loading of PET2001-saved files (that
have $0400 as load address) and other PET files (that have $0401).
The PET2001 still saves from $0400, not from $0401 as other PETs do.

@c @strong{Warning:} The (German) machine language lessons from
@c @url{ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm} are one byte too short (the files
@c @file{machineles*} in the @file{basicles.lha} archive there).  This
@c usually results in a machine lockup after load.  To use them you have to
@c type the following before loading:

@c @example
@c NEW
@c FOR I=1200 TO 8192:POKE I,0:NEXT
@c @end example

@c This clears the memory, which kind of emulates the last
@c missing nullbyte: you can also achieve the same result using
@c the built-in monitor with

@c @example
@c fill 400 2000 0
@c @end example

@c When saving, the PET2001 adds an additional byte to the file,
@c so those files might grow!

Moreover, the secondary addresses being used now are @code{0} and
@code{1} for load and save, and not arbitrary unused secondary
addresses.

To select which model to run, you specify the model on the
command line with the @code{-model MODEL} option, where
@code{MODEL} can be one of a list of PET model numbers, all
described in @pxref{PET model}
@c FIXME link!


@node CBM-II emulator features, Keyboard emulation, PET emulator features, Preface
@section CBM-II emulator features

The CBM-II emulator emulates several types of CBM-II models. Those models
are known under different names in the USA and Europe.
In the States they have been sold as @code{B128} and @code{B256}, in 
Europe as @code{CBM 610}, @code{CBM 620} (low-profile case) or
@code{CBM 710} and @code{CBM 720} (high-profile case with monitor).

These computers are prepared to take a coprocessor board with an 8088
or Z80 CPU. Indeed there are models @code{CBM 630} and @code{CBM 730}
that supposedly had those processors. However these models are not
emulated.

The basic difference is the amount of RAM these machines have been supplied
with. The @code{B128} and the @code{CBM *10} models had 128k RAM, the 
others 256k. This implies some banking scheme, as the 6502 can only
address 64k. And indeed those machines use a 6509, that can address
1 MByte of RAM. It has 2 registers at addresses 0 and 1. The indirekt bank
register at address 1 determines the bank (0-15) where the opcodes
@code{LDA (zp),Y} and @code{STA (zp),Y} take the data from. The exec bank
register at address 0 determines the bank where all other read and
write addresses take place.

Many models have been expanded to more than the built-in memory. In fact
some machines have been expanded to the full 1M. 
Bank 15 is used as system bank, with only little RAM, and lots of
expansion cartridge ROM area, the I/O and the kernal/basic ROMs.
Some models have been modified to map RAM into the expansion ROM area.
Those modifications can be emulated as well.

The different settings are described in @pxref{CBM-II model}.

@node Keyboard emulation, Joystick emulation, CBM-II emulator features, Preface
@section The keyboard emulation

There are two ways of emulating the keyboard in VICE.

The default way (@dfn{symbolic mapping}) is to map every X11 key
combination to the corresponding key combination on the real machine:
for example, if you press @key{*}, which is bound to @kbd{Shift-8} on a
U.S. keyboard, in the C64 emulator, the emulated machine will have just
the @emph{unshifted} @key{*} key pressed (as @key{*} is unshifted on the
C64 keyboard).  Likewise, pressing @key{'} on the same U.S. keyboard
without any shift key will cause the combination @kbd{Shift-7} to be
pressed in the emulated C64.  This way, it becomes quite obvious what
keys should be typed to obtain all the symbols.

There is one problem with symbolic mapping, though: some keys have to be
mapped specially anyway.  The most important execption is that, in the
VIC20, C64 and C128 emulators, @key{CTRL} is mapped to @key{Tab} and the
@key{Commodore} key is mapped to the left @key{Control}).

@c (@dots{}) FIXME: we need the detailed list here.

The second way (@dfn{positional mapping}) is to map every key on the
``real'' keyboard to the key which has the same position on the keyboard
of the emulated machine.  This way, no @key{Shift} key is forced by the
program (with the exception of the function keys @key{F2}, @key{F4},
@key{F6} and @key{F8}, which require @key{Shift} on the Commodore
keyboards), and the keyboard is more comfortable to use in those
programs (such as some games) that require the keys to be in the correct
positions.

@strong{Warning:} unlike the real C64, VICE ``presses'' the @key{Shift}
key @emph{together} with the key to shift when the @key{Shift} must be
forced.  In most cases this should work fine, but some keyboard routines
are quite picky and tend not to recognize the shift key because of this.
For instance, @kbd{F6} (which on the real C64 is obtained with
@kbd{Shift + F5}) could be recognized as @kbd{F5}.  In that case, use
the shift key manually (i.e. type @kbd{Shift + F5} in the example).
Yes, we know this is a bug.

The @kbd{RESTORE} key is mapped to @kbd{Page Up} (or @kbd{Prev}).


@node Joystick emulation, Disk drive emulation, Keyboard emulation, Preface
@section The joystick emulation

Joysticks can be emulated both via the keyboard and via a real joystick
connected to the host machine (the latter only works on GNU/Linux
systems).

There are two keyboard layouts, called @dfn{numpad} and @dfn{custom}
layouts respectively.

The @dfn{numpad} layout uses the numeric keypad keys, i.e. the numbers
@key{1}@dots{}@key{9} which emulate all the directions including the
diagonal ones; @key{0} emulates the fire button.

The @dfn{custom} layout uses the keys @key{w}, @key{e}, @key{r},
@key{s}, @key{d}, @key{f}, @key{x}, @key{c}, @key{v} for the directions
and @key{space} for the fire button instead.


@node Disk drive emulation, File formats, Joystick emulation, Preface
@section The disk drive emulation

All the emulators support emulation of up to 4 external disk drives as
devices 8, 9, 10 and 11.  Each of these devices can emulate virtual
Commodore 1541 drives in two ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
using disk images, i.e. files that contain a dump
of all the blocks contained in a real floppy disk (if you want more
information about what a disk image is, consult the
@code{comp.emulators.cbm} FAQ);
@item
accessing file system directories, thus allowing you to access files
without having to copy them to disk images; this also allows you to
read and write files in the @code{P00} format (again, consult the
@code{comp.emulators.cbm} FAQ for more info).
@end itemize

Moreover, there are two available types of 1541 emulation for the first
kind of emulation.  One of them the @dfn{DOS level} drive emulation.  It
does @emph{not} really emulate the serial line, but patches the kernal
ROM (with the so-called @dfn{kernal traps}) so that serial line
operations can be emulated via C language routines.  This emulation is
very fast, but only allows use of standard DOS functions (and not even
all of them).

The other alternative is a @dfn{hardware level} drive emulation.  The
Commodore 1541 disk drive was provided with its own CPU (a 6502 as the
VIC20 and the PETs) and its own RAM and ROM.  So, in order to more
closely emulate its features, a complete emulation of this hardware must
be provided and that is what the @dfn{hardware level} emulation does.
When the @dfn{hardware level} emulation is used, the kernal routines are
no longer patched and the serial line is fully emulated.  The problem
with this emulation is that it needs a lot of processing power, mainly
because the emulator has to emulate two CPUs instead of one.

The @dfn{hardware level} emulation is only available on the VIC20 and
C64 emulators, and can only be used to emulate one drive at a time.  As
a consequence, it is only available for unit 8 and disables all the
other drives when activated.

On the other hand, the PETs don't use a serial IEC bus to communicate
with the floppy, instead they use the parallel IEEE488 bus.  This bus
transfers @emph{byte by byte}, as opposed to @emph{bit by bit} as the
C64 and VIC20 do, so in this case it is feasible to emulate the parallel
line completely while emulating the drive at DOS level only.  The
IEEE488 line interpreter maps the drives 8-11 (as described above) to
the IEEE488 disk units, and no kernal traps are needed.  The same
emulation is available in the C64, to emulate the Commodore IEEE488 bus
interface.

@node File formats, Common problems, Disk drive emulation, Preface
@section Supported file formats

VICE supports the most popular Commodore file formats:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{X64} (preferred) or @code{D64} disk image files;

@item
@code{G64} GCR-encoded 1541 disk image files;

@item
@code{T64} tape image files (read-only);

@item
@code{P00} program files;

@end itemize

An utility (@code{c1541}, @pxref{c1541}) is provided to allow transfers
between these formats.

Notice that the native format for disk images is @code{X64}; this
means that, although the emulators and utilities can both read and write
on @code{D64} disk images, they never produce @code{D64} files.

@cindex Converting X64 files into D64
You can convert an @code{X64} file back into a @code{D64} file with the
UNIX @code{dd} command:

@example
dd bs=64 skip=1 if=IMAGE.X64 of=IMAGE.D64
@end example

and how to resolve them.

@end menu

@node Sound problems, Shared memory problems, Common problems, Common problems
@subsection Sound problems

VICE should compile and run without major problems on many UNIX systems,
but there are some known issues related to the sound driver.  In fact,
sound is the least portable part of the emulator and has not been
thoroughly tested on all the supported platforms yet.

Linux, AIX and SGI systems should play sound without any problems; if
you are running Linux please use the new 2.x kernels, as VICE needs some
features that were not implemented in older versions of the Linux sound
driver.

@cindex HP-UX and Solaris audio problems
On the other hand, HP-UX and Solaris machines are known to cause
troubles.  If you think you can help debugging the code for these
systems, your help would be really appreciated.  We are having troubles
finding HP-UX and SUN consoles to work at@dots{}


@node Shared memory problems,  , Sound problems, Common problems
@subsection Shared memory problems

@cindex MITSHM
@cindex -mitshm, +mitshm
If you cannot start VICE, because you get errors about shared memory,
try to run it with the @samp{+mitshm} command-line option (@pxref{Video
options}).  This will completely disable usage of the MITSHM
extensions, that are normally used to speed up the process of updating
the emulation window.  Of course, this will also result in a big loss in
speed.

Reasons for this failure could be:

@itemize @bullet
@item
IPC support has been disabled from the system; some system
administrators disable this for security reasons.  If @emph{you} are the
system administrator, use a kernel that has IPC support compiled in and
enabled.
@item
You are attempting to run the emulator across the network (ie. the
emulator runs on a machine, and the output is displayed on another
machine that works as an X terminal), and for some reason VICE does not
recognize that.  In this case, you have found a bug, so please report it
to us.
@end itemize

If you want to avoid running the emulator with @samp{+mitshm} every
time, run it once with @samp{+mitshm} and then choose ``Save settings''
from the right-button menu.


@node Usage, System files, Preface, Top
@chapter Invoking the emulators

The names of the available emulators are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{x64}, the C64 emulator

@item
@code{x128}, the C128 emulator

@item
@code{xpet}, the PET emulator

@item
@code{xvic}, the VIC20 emulator

@item
@code{x610}, the CBM-II emulator

@end itemize

You can run each of them by simply typing the name from a shell.  If you
want to run them from another application (e.g. a window manager or some
other sort of program launcher) you should always run them from a
terminal window such as @code{xterm} or @code{rxvt}, as a lot of
debugging information is printed and the built-in monitor will be run in
there.  For example, you could do

@example
xterm -e x64

There are several options you can specify on the command line.  Some of
them are used to specify emulation settings; they will be described in

@end table


@node Command-line autostart,  , Command-line initialization, Usage
@section Autostarting programs from the command-line

It is possible to let the emulator @dfn{autostart} a disk or tape image
file, by simply specifying its name as the @emph{last} argument on the
command line; for example

@example
x64 lovelygame.x64.gz
@end example

will start the C64 emulator, attaching @file{lovelygame.x64.gz} as a
disk image and running the first program on it.  You can also specify
the name of the program on the fisk image by appending a colon
(@samp{:}) the name itself to the argument; for example

@example
x64 "lovelygame.x64.gz:run me"
@end example

will run the program named @file{run me} on @file{lovelygame.x64.gz}
instead of the first one.

@cindex -autostart
Using the command-line option @code{-autostart} is equivalent; so the same
result can be obtained with

@example
x64 -autostart "lovelygame.x64.gz:run me"
@end example

@xref{Disk and tape images} for more information about images and
autostart.


@node System files, Basics, Usage, Top
@chapter System files

In order to work properly, the emulators need to load a few system
files:

@itemize @bullet

@item
the @dfn{system ROMs}, raw binary files containing copies of the original ROMs
of the machine you are emulating;

@item
the @dfn{keyboard maps}, text files describing the keyboard layout;

@item
the @dfn{palette files}, text files describing the colors of the machine you
are emulating.

@end itemize

The place where they will be searched for depends on the value of the
@code{Directory} resource, which is a colon (@code{;})-separated search
path list, like the @sc{unix} @code{PATH} environment variable.  The
default value is

@example
PREFIX/lib/vice/EMU:BOOTPATH/EMU
@end example

Where @code{PREFIX} is the installation prefix (usually
@file{/usr/local}), @code{EMU} is the name of the emulated machine
(@code{C64}, @code{C128}, @code{PET} or @code{VIC20}) and
@code{BOOTPATH} is the directory where the executable resides.

For example, if you have the C64 emulator installed in

@example
/usr/local/bin/x64
@end example

then the value will be

@example
/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64;/usr/local/bin/C64
@end example

And system files will be searched for under the following directories,
in the specified order:

@enumerate 1
@item
@code{/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64}
@item
@code{/usr/local/bin/C64}
@end enumerate

System files can still be installed in a different directory if you
specify a complete path instead of just a file name.  For example, if
you specify @file{./kernal} as the kernal image name, the kernal image
will be loaded from the current directory.  This can be done by using
command-line options or by modifying resource values (@pxref{Resource
files}).

@node ROM files, Keymap files, System files, System files
@section ROM files

Every emulator requires its own ROM set.  For the VIC20 and the C64, the
ROM set consists in the following files:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{kernal},  the Kernal ROM (8 KBytes)

@item
@file{basic}, the Basic ROM (8 KBytes)

@item
@file{chargen}, the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos1541}, the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

@end itemize

The C128 needs the following files instead:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{kernal}, the Kernal ROM (8 Kbytes)

@item
@file{basic}, the BASIC + Editor ROM (32 Kbytes)

@item
@file{chargen}, the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos1541}, the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

@end itemize

The PET emulator uses a quite different setup instead: the Basic and
Kernal ROMS are packed into a single file and only three kernal files
are provided; one for each basic revision.  To handle the different
screen sizes and keyboards, different so-called ``editor-ROMs'' for the
memory range $E000-$E800 are provided.  The kernal files contain an
editor ROM for 40 columns and graphics keyboard already.  The PET ROMs
have the following names:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{pet2001}, the PET2001 Basic 1 + Kernal ROM (16 KBytes)

@item
@file{pet3032}, the PET3032 Basic 2 + Kernal ROM (16 KBytes)

@item
@file{pet4032}, the PET4032/8032 Basic 4 + Kernal ROM (20
KBytes)

@item
@file{edit2.b}, the PET3032 editor for business keyboard (2
KBytes)

@item
@file{edit4.b40}, the PET4032 editor for business keyboard
(2 KBytes)

@item
@file{edit4.b80}, the PET8032 editor for 80 columns and
business keyboard (2 KBytes)

@end itemize

The PETs also have sockets for extension ROMs for the addresses
$9000-$9FFF, $A000-$AFFF and $B000-$BFFF (the last one for PET2001 and
PET3032 only).  You can specify ROM image files for those extensions
command line options @code{-petrom9}, @code{-petromA} and
@code{-petromB} resp.

An alternative would be to specify a long kernal ROM with the
@code{-kernal} option that includes the extension ROM areas already.

Also, you can specify a replacement for the basic ROM at $B000-$DFFF
with the @code{-petromBasic} option and a replacement for the editor ROM
at $E000-$E7FF with the @code{-petromEditor} option.


@node Keymap files, Palette files, ROM files, System files
@section Keymap files

@dfn{Keymap files} are used to define the keyboard layout, defining what
key (or combination of keys) must me mapped to ever keysym.

In other words, the keyboard emulation works like this: whenever the
user presses o releases a key while the input focus in the emulation
window, the emulator receives an X-Window event with a value that
identifies that key.  That value is called a @dfn{keysym} and is unique
to that key.  Then the emulator looks for that keysym into an internal
table which tells it what key(s) to press or release on the emulated
keyboard.

This table is described by the keymap file, which is made up of lines
like the following:

@example
KEYSYM ROW COLUMN SHIFTFLAG
@end example

Where:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{KEYSYM} is a string identifying the keysym: you can use the
@code{xev} utility (shipped with the X Window system) to see what keysym
is bound to any key;

@item
@code{ROW} and @code{COLUMN} identify the key on the emulated keyboard;

@item
@code{SHIFTFLAG} can have one of the following values:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{0}: the key is never shifted;

@item
@code{1}: the key is shifted;

@item
@code{2}: the key is the left shift;

@item
@code{4}: the key is the right shift;

@item
@code{8}: the key can be (optionally) shifted by the user.

@end itemize

@end itemize

The @code{SHIFTFLAG} is useful if you want certain keys to be
``artificially'' shifted by the emulator, and not by the user.  For
example, @key{F2} is shifted on the C64 keyboard, but you might want it
to be mapped to the unshifted @key{F2} key on the PC keyboard.  To do
so, you just have to use a line like the following:

@example
F2 0 4 1
@end example

where @code{0} and @code{4} identify the key (row 0, column 4 on the
keyboard matrix), and @code{1} specifies that every time the user presses
@key{F2} the shift key on the C64 keyboard must be pressed.

There are also some special commands you can put into the keyboard file;
they are recognized because they start with an exclamation mark:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{!CLEAR} clears the currently loaded keyboard map; it is
necessary to put this at the beginning of the file if you want the
keymap file to override all of the current internal settings;

@item
@code{!LSHIFT}, @code{!RSHIFT}, followed by a row and a column
value, specify where the left and right shift keys are located on the
emulated keyboard; for example, C64 default keymaps will specify

@example
!LSHIFT 1 7
!RSHIFT 6 4
@end example

@end itemize

Any line starting with the @code{#} sign, instead, is completely
ignored.  This is useful for adding comments within the keymap file.

VICE keymap files have the @file{.vkm} default extension, and every
emulator comes with a default positional mapping and a default symbolic
mapping.


@node Palette files,  , Keymap files, System files
@section Palette files

@dfn{Palette files} are used to specify the colors used in the
emulators.  They are made up of lines like the following:

@example
RED GREEN BLUE DITHER
@end example

where @code{RED}, @code{GREEN} and @code{BLUE} are hexadecimal values
ranging from 0 to FF and specifying the amount of red, green and blue
you want for each color and @code{DITHER} is an hexadecimal 4-bit
number specifying the pattern you want to be used when rendering on a
B/W display.

You have to include as many lines as the number of colors the emulated
machine has, and the order of the lines must respect the one used in the
machine (so the N'th line must contain the specifications for color N -
1 in the emulated machine).

Lines starting with the @code{#} sign are completely ignored.  This is
useful for adding comments (such as color names) within the palette
file.

For example, the default PET palette file (which has only two colors, 0 for
background and 1 for foreground), looks like the following:

@example
#
# VICE Palette file
#
# Syntax:
# Red Green Blue Dither
#

# Background
00 00 00 0

# Foreground
00 FF 00 F

@node Emulation window, Menus, Basics, Basics
@section The emulation window

When the emulator is run, the screen of the emulated machine is
displayed in a standard X Window which we will call the @dfn{emulation
window}.  This window will be updated in real-time, displaying the same
contents that a real monitor or TV set would.

Under the emulation window there is an area which is used to display
information about the state of the emulator; we will call this area the
@dfn{status bar}.

On the extreme left of the status bar, there is a @dfn{performance
meter}.  The performance meter displays the current relative speed (in
percent) of the emulator and the update frequency, in frames per second.
All the machines emulated are PAL, so the update frequency will be of 50
frames per second if your system is fast enough to allow the emulator to
run at the speed of the real machine.

On the extreme right of the status bar, there is a @dfn{drive status
indicator}.  This is only visible if the hardware-level (``True'') 1541
emulation is turned on.  In that case, the drive status indicator will
contain a rectangle which emulates the drive LED and will display the
current track position of the read-write head of the drive.

@node Menus, Help, Emulation window, Basics
@section Using the menus

It is possible to execute some commands and change emulation parameters
while running the emulator: two menus are available by pressing the
right or left mouse buttons while the pointer is in the emulation
window.  The left mouse button will open the @dfn{command menu} from
which several emulation-related commands can be executed; the right
mouse button will open the @dfn{setting menu}, from which emulation
parameters can be changed.  The basic difference between the command and
the setting menu is that, while commands have only effect on the current
session, settings can be saved for later use: this can be done with the
``Save settings'' and ``Load settings'' right-button menu items.
``Restore default settings'' restores the factory defaults.
@xref{Settings and resources} for more information about how settings
work in VICE.

Sometimes commands can be reached via @dfn{shortcuts} or @dfn{hotkeys},
i.e. it is possible to reach them by pressing a sequence of keys instead
of going through the menu with the mouse; when this happens, the
corresponding shortcut is displayed in parenthesis on the right of the
menu item.  In VICE, all the shortcuts must begin with the @key{Meta} or
@key{Alt} key.  So, for example, to attach a disk image to drive #8 (the
corresponding menu item displays ``M-8''), you have to press the
@key{Meta} (or @key{Alt}) and then @key{8}.

Notice that, while @key{Meta} or @key{Alt} is pressed, pressing other
keys has no effect at all on the emulated machine.


@node Help, File Selector, Menus, Basics
@section Getting help

In case you suddenly get stuck or do not remember how to do a certain
thing, you can in any moment use the ``Browse manuals'' command (left
button menu).  This will popup a browser and open the HTML version of
this documentation.  Notice that this requires VICE to be properly (and
fully) installed with a @samp{make install}.

The browser can be specified via the @code{HTMLBrowserCommand} string
resource (@pxref{Settings and resources} for information about
resources).  Every @samp{%s} in the string will be replaced with a URL
to the VICE HTML pages.


@node File Selector, Disk and tape images, Help, Basics
@section Using the file selector

In those situations where it is necessary to specify a file name, all
of the VICE emulators will pop up a file selector window which allows
you to select one file interactively.

On the left of the file selector, there is a list of ancestor
directories: by clicking on them, you can go up the directory tree.  On
the right, there is a list of the files in the current directory; files
can be selected by clicking on them.  If you click on a directory, that
directory becomes the current one; if you click on an ordinary file, it
becomes active.

On the top, there are a @dfn{directory box}, with the complete path of
the current directory, and a @dfn{file name box}, with the name of the
file you are selecting.  On the bottom there are two buttons: ``OK''
confirms the selected file and ``Cancel'' abandons the file selector
without cancelling the operation.

It is also possible to specify what files you want to show in the file
selector by writing an appropriate shell-like pattern in the directory
box; eg. @samp{~/*.[dx]64} will only show files in the home directory whose
name ends with @file{.d64} or @file{*.x64}.


@node Disk and tape images, Reset, File Selector, Basics
@section Using disk and tape images

The emulator is able to emulate disk drives and (read-only) tape
recorders if provided with suitable @dfn{disk images} or @dfn{tape
images}.  An @dfn{image} is a raw dump of the contents of the media, and
must be @dfn{attached} before the emulator can use it.  ``Attaching'' a
disk or tape image is like ``virtually'' inserting a diskette or a
cassette into the disk drive or the tape recorder: after an image is
attached, the emulator is able to use it as a storage media.

There are five commands (in the left button menu) that deal with disk
and tape images:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Attach Disk Image
@item
Detach Disk Image
@item
Attach Tape Image
@item
Detach Tape Image
@item
Smart-attach a file

@end itemize

The first four commands are used to insert and remove the virtual disks
and cassette tapes from the respective units.  On the other hand, the
last commands tries to guess the type of the image you are attaching
from its name and size, and attaches it to the most reasonable device.

Supported formats are @code{D64} and @code{X64} for disk images (devices
8, 9 and 10) and @code{T64} for tape images.  Notice that @code{T64}
support is @emph{read-only}, and that the cassette is automatically
rewound from the start when you reach the end.

Another important feature is that raw Commodore BASIC binary files and
.P00 files can be attached as tapes.  As you can autostart a
tape image when it is attached (@pxref{Autostart}), this allows you to
autostart these particular files as well.

You can attach a disk for which you do have write permissions: when this
happens, the 1541 emulator will emulate a write-protected disk.  This is
also useful if you want to preserve certain disk image from being
written to; in the latter case, just remove the write permission for
that file, eg. doing a @code{chmod a-w}.

@menu
* Previewing contents::         Looking into the image before attaching it.
* Autostart::                   Starting a program automagically.
* Compressed files::            Dealing with compressed files.
* Zipcode and Lynx::            Using Zipcoded ([1-4]!*) and Lynx files.
@end menu

@node Previewing contents, Autostart, Disk and tape images, Disk and tape images
@subsection Previewing the image contents

It is possible to look into the disk or tape image and see its directory
before attaching it: to do so, just press the ``Contents'' button in the
file selector window.  This way, a new window will be popped up with the
contents of the selected image.

Notice that this function automatically translates the directory from
PETSCII to ASCII; but, due to differences in the two encodings, it is
not always possible to translate all the characters, so you might get
funny results when ``weird'' characters such as the semi-graphical ones
are being used.


@node Autostart, Compressed files, Previewing contents, Disk and tape images
@subsection ``Autostarting'' an image

If you want to reset the machine and run the first program on a certain
image without typing any commands at the Commodore BASIC prompt, you can
use the ``Autostart'' button in the file selector window after selecting
a proper disk or tape image file.

Notice that, if true 1541 emulation is turned on, it will be turned off
before running the program and then turned on again after it has been
loaded.  This way, you get the maximum possible speed while loading the
file, but you don't loose compatibility when the actual program is
running.

This method is not completely safe, because some autostarting methods
might cause the true 1541 emulation not to be turned on again.  In such
cases, the best thing to do is to disable kernal traps (which will cause
true 1541 emulation to be always kept turned on), or to manually load
the program with true 1541 emulation turned on.


@node Compressed files, Zipcode and Lynx, Autostart, Disk and tape images
@subsection Using compressed files

It is also possible to attach disk or tape images that have been
compressed through various algorithms; the compression format is
recognized from the file extension.  The following formats are supported
(the expected file name extension is in parenthesis):

@itemize @bullet
@item
GNU Zip (@code{.gz} or @code{.z});
@item
BZip version 2 (@code{.bz2});
@item
PkZip (@code{.zip});
@item
GNU Zipped TAR archives (@code{.tar.gz}, @code{.tgz});
@item
Zoo (@code{.zoo}).
@end itemize

PkZip, @code{tar.gz}, @code{lha} and @code{zoo} support is
@emph{read-only} and always uses the @emph{first} @code{T64} or
@code{D64} file in the archive.  So archives containing multiple files
will always be handled as if they contained one single file.


@node Zipcode and Lynx,  , Compressed files, Disk and tape images
@subsection Using Zipcode and Lynx images

Since version 0.15, the VICE emulators are able to attach disks packed
with Zipcoded or Lynx without the need of converting them into
@code{D64} or @code{X64} files with @code{c1541}.  This is done by
executing @code{c1541}, letting it decode the file into a temporary
image, and then by attaching the temporary image read-only.  For this
reason, the directory @code{c1541} is contained in must be in your
@code{PATH}.

This uses the @code{-unlynx} and @code{-zcreate} options of @code{c1541}
(@pxref{c1541 commands and options}); these commands are not very
reliable yet, and could fail with certain kinds of Lynx and Zipcode
images (for example, they cannot deal with @code{DEL} files properly).
So please use with care.

Lynx files usually come as @file{.lnx} files and are depacked into a
single disk.  On the other hand, Zipcode files do not have a particular
extension (although @file{.z64} is sometimes used), and represent a disk
by means of four sub-files, named as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{1!NAME}
@item
@file{2!NAME}
@item
@file{3!NAME}
@item
@file{4!NAME}
@end itemize

If you attach as a disk image (or smart-attach) any of these files, the
emulator will simply pick up the other three parts (by looking at the
name) and build one disk image out of them.


@node Reset,  , Disk and tape images, Basics
@section Resetting the machine

You can reset the emulated machine at any time by using the ``Reset''
command from the command menu.  There are two types of reset:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@dfn{soft reset}, which simply resets the CPU and all the chips;
@item
@dfn{hard reset}, which also clears up the contents of RAM.
@end itemize

A @dfn{soft reset} is the same as a hardware reset achieved by pulling
the @sc{reset} line down; a @dfn{hard reset} is more like a power
on/power off sequence, which makes sure the whole RAM is cleared.

It is possible that a soft reset is not enough to bring the machine back
to the OS initialization sequence: in such cases, you have to do a hard
reset instead.


@node Settings and resources, Machine-specific features, Basics, Top
@chapter Settings and resources

In the VICE emulators, all the settings are stored in entities which are
called @dfn{resources}.  Every resource has a name and its value can be
either an integer or a string.  Often integer values are used as boolean
values, with the usual convention of using zero for ``false'' and any
other value for ``true''.

Resource values can be changed via the right-button menu (the
@dfn{settings} menu), via command-line options or via the @dfn{resource
file}.

The @dfn{resource file} is a human-readable file containing resource
values: it is called @file{.vicerc} and is stored in the user's home
directory.  At any time, it is possible to dump the current values of
the resources into that file or load the values stored into that file as
the current values.  This can be achieved with the ``Save settings'' and
``Load settings'' right menu items.  A third menu item, ``Restore
Default Settings'', can be used to set all the values to the factory
defaults.

A special resource, @code{SaveResourcesOnExit}, if set to a non zero
value, causes the emulator to ask you if you want to save the current
(changed) settings before exiting, and can be toggled with the ``Save
settings on exit'' command from the right-button menu.

Notice that not all the resources can be changed from the menus; some of
them can only be changed by manually modifying the resource file or by
using command-line options.

@menu

@end menu

@node Resource files, Resources and command-line, Settings and resources, Settings and resources
@section Format of resource files

A resource file is made up of several sections; sections have the
purpose of separating the resources of a certain emulator from the ones
of the other emulators.  A section is started with the name of an
emulator in brackets (eg. @samp{[C64]}) and ends when another section
starts, or the file ends.

Every line in a section has the following format:

@example
RESOURCE=VALUE
@end example

where @code{RESOURCE} is the name of a resource, while @code{VALUE} is
the value to assign.  Resource names are case-sensitive, and resource
values can be either strings or integers.  Strings must start and end
with a double quote (@code{"}), while integers do just have to be
written in decimal notation.

Here is an example of a stripped-down @file{.vicerc} file:

@example
[VIC20]
HTMLBrowserCommand="netscape %s"
SaveResourcesOnExit=0
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/vic20p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1
[C64]
HTMLBrowserCommand="netscape %s"
SaveResourcesOnExit=1
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/c64p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1
@end example

Notice that, when resource values are saved with ``Save settings'', the
emulator only modifies its own section, keeping the other ones
unchanged.

@node Resources and command-line, Performance settings, Resource files, Settings and resources
@section Using command-line options to change resources

Resources can also be changed via command-line options.

Command-line options always override the defaults from @code{.vicerc},
and their value lasts for the whole session.  So, if you specify a
certain command-line option that changes a certain resource from its
default value and then use ``Save Settings'', the value specified with
the command-line option will be saved.

Command-line options can begin with with the minus sign (@samp{-}) or
with the plus sign (@samp{+}).  Options beginning with the minus sign
can require an additional parameter, while the ones beginning with the
plus sign never require one.

Moreover, options beginning with the plus sign always have a counterpart
with the same name, but with the minus sign; in that case, the option
beginning with the minus sign is used to @emph{enable} a certain
feature, while the one beginning with the plus sign is used to
@emph{disable} the same feature (this is an X11 convention).  For
example, @code{-mitshm} enables support of MITSHM, while @code{+mitshm}
disables it.


@node Performance settings, Video settings, Resources and command-line, Settings and resources
@section Performance settings

@cindex Limiting emulation speed
It is possible to control the emulation speed by using the ``Maximum
speed'' menu item in the right-button menu.  The default setting is
@code{100}, which causes the emulation to never run faster than the real
machine.  A higher value makes the emulator faster, a lower one makes it
slower.  The setting ``No limit'' means to run as fast as possible,
without limiting speed.

@cindex Refresh rate
It is also possible to control the amount of screen frames the emulator
calculates with the ``Refresh rate'' setting; the value ranges from
``1/1'' (update 1/1 of the frames of the real machine, that is 50 frames
per second) to ``1/10'' (update 1 every 10 frames) and can be changed
via the ``Refresh Rate'' submenu.  The ``Auto'' setting means to
dynamically adapt the refresh rate to the current speed of the host
machine, making sure the maximum speed specified by the via ``Maxium
speed'' is always reached if possible.  In any case, the
refresh rate will never be worse than 1/10 if this option is specified.

Notice that you cannot specify ``Auto'' as the refresh rate and ``No
limit'' as the maximum speed at the same time.

@cindex Warp speed mode
Moreover, a special @dfn{warp speed} mode is provided and can be toggled
with the ``Enable Warp Mode'' menu item.  If this mode is enabled, it
will cause the emulator to disable any speed limit, turn sound emulation
off and use a 1/10 refresh rate, so that it will run at the maximum
possible speed.

@node Video settings, Keyboard settings, Performance settings, Settings and resources
@section Video settings

The following right-button menu items control the video output:

@itemize @bullet

@cindex Video cache
@item
``Video Cache'' enables a video cache that can speed up the emulation
when little graphics activity is going on; it is especially useful when
you run the emulator on a networked X terminal, as it can reduce the
amount of bandwidth required.  But this can actually make the emulator
slower when there is little graphics activity and the amount of work
needed to maintain the cache is bigger than the amount of work that
would be wasted by not using it (if any).

@cindex Double-size mode
@item
``Double Size'' toggles @dfn{double-size mode}, which makes the
emulation window twice as big.  When emulating a 80-column PET, only the
height is doubled, so that the aspect ratio is more similiar to the one
of the real thing.

@cindex Double-scan mode.
@item
``Double Scan'' toggles @dfn{double-scan mode}, which causes the
emulator to draw only odd lines when running in double-size mode (this
saves some CPU time and also makes the emulation window look more like
an old monitor).

@cindex Using XSync()
@cindex Loosing control on low-end systems
@item
`Use XSync()'' causes the emulator to call the X11 function
@code{XSync()} before updating the emulation window: this might be
necessary on low-end systems to prevent it from stealing so many system
resources that it would become impossible for the user to interact with
it.

@node 1541 settings, Peripheral settings, Sound settings, Settings and resources
@section 1541 settings

These settings are used to control the emulation of the 1541 drive.

@itemize @bullet

@item
``Enable true 1541 emulation'' enables the slow hardware-level
emulation of the 1541 drive number 8 for maximum compatibility.

@item
``Enable parallel cable'' enables emulation of a SpeedDOS parallel
cable; if you switch this option on and replace the original Commodore
ROMs with SpeedDOS-compatible ones, you can speed up loading/saving times.

@item
``True 1541 sync factor'' specifies the speed of the 1541 CPU.  This can
be used to help loading certain programs that have trouble with the
default PAL setting (for example, programs designed for NTSC machines).
The ratio is calculated as follows:

@example
sync_factor = 65536 * clk_1541 / clk_machine
@end example

where @code{clk_1541} and @code{clk_machine} are clock speeds in MHz.
The menu lets you choose between the PAL and NTSC values, and also lets
you specify whatever value you want.  Be careful when changing it,
though, because a wrong value can break things and even corrupt disk
images.

@item
``True 1541 idle method'' specifies which method the 1541 emulation
should use to save CPU cycles.  There are three methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@dfn{Skip cycles}: Each time the serial line is accessed by the C64, the
drive executes all the cycles since the last time it was running.  If
the number of elapsed cycles is larger than a certain value, the drive
discards part of them.
@item
@dfn{Trap idle}: The disk drive is still emulated upon serial line
accesses as with the previous option, but it is also always emulated at
the end of each screen frame.  If the drive gets into the DOS idle loop,
only pending interrupts are emulated to save time.
@item
@dfn{No traps}: Like ``Trap idle'', but without traps at all.  So
basically the 1541 works exactly as with the real thing, and nothing is
done to reduce the power needs of the 1541 emulation.
@end itemize

The first option (``Skip cycles'') is usually better for performance, as
the drive is emulated as little as possible; on the other hand, you can
notice sudden slowdowns (when the drive executes several cycles at once)
and the LED status is never updated (because it would not be possible to
do correctly so).  Moreover, if the drive tries to get in sync with the
computer in some weird way and the computer does not access the serial
line for a long time, it is possible that some cycles are discarded and
the sync is lost.  Notice that this hack can have no effect on
performance if one program continuously reads from the IEC port, as the
drive will have to be emulated in any case (some stupid programs do so,
even when they don't actually need to use the drive).

@c without this, texi2html strips our end-of-paragraph away.
@c maybe we should patch it?
@ifhtml
<P>
@end ifhtml

The second option (``Trap idle'') is usually a bit slower, as at least
interrupts are always emulated, but allows the LED state to be always
updated correctly and always keeps the 1541 and the computer in sync.
On the other hand, if a program installs a non-standard idle loop in the
drive, the 1541 CPU has to be emulated even when not necessary and the
global emulation speed is then @emph{much} slower.

@item
``40-track image support'' specifies how 40-track (``extended'') disk
images should be supported.  There are three possible ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
``Never extend'' never extends disk images at all (so if a program tries
to write tracks beyond the 35th, it is not allowed to do so);
@item
``Ask on extend'' prompts the user as soon as a program tries to write
tracks beyond the 35th, and the user can then choose whether she wants
the disk image to be extended or not;
@item
``Extend on access'' simply extends the disk image as soon the program
needs it, without prompting the user.

@node Printer settings, No kernal traps, File system device settings, Peripheral settings
@subsection Printer settings

The VICE emulators can emulate printers connected to either the IEC
buffer or the user port.  Emulation can be achieved by redirecting the
printer output to a file or by piping it through an external process.
This is defined by so-called @dfn{printer device file names}; a printer
device file name can be either a simple path, or a command name
prepended by the pipe symbol @samp{|}.

For example, printer device @samp{filename} will cause the output to be
appended to file @file{filename}, while printer device @samp{|lpr} will
cause the @code{lpr} command to be executed and fed with the printer
output.

Up to three printer devices can be specified through the following
resources:

@itemize @bullet
@item
device 1, whose default value is @code{print.dump};
@item
device 2, whose default value is @code{|petlp |lpr};
@item
device 3, whose default value is @code{|lpr}.
@end itemize

So, basically, by default printer device 1 will simply dump printer
output to @file{print.dump}; printer device 2 will print it via
@code{petlp} (a not-complete-yet utility that will produce Postscript
output from it) and @code{lpr}; printer device 2 will print it through
@code{lpr}.

@dfn{Cartridge images} are like disk images, but mirror the contents of
cartridge ROM images instead of disk images.  They are currently
not supported on the C128 emulator.

X64 allows you to attach the following kinds of cartridges:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{.crt} images, as used by the CCS64 emulator by Per H@^akan Sundell;
@item
generic raw dumps of 8K and 16K images;
@item
Action Replay images.
@end itemize

Each of these kinds has a specific command in the ``Attach a cartridge
image'' submenu.  When you have successfully attached a cartridge image,
you should then reset the machine to make sure the cartridge initializes
itself.  Of course, it is also possible to detach a currently attached
cartridge image (``Detach cartridge image'').

If you are using an Action Replay cartridge, you can emulate the
cartridge's freeze button with the ``Freeze'' command.

@cindex C64/128 emulator identification
@item
The ``emulator identification'' extension allows programs to

returns some values which identify the emulator itself, its version and
a copyright message.  If this extension is disabled, programs will have
virtually no way to realize they are running on an emulator.

X64 and X128 can support RS232 in the following ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
by emulating Daniel Dallmann's 9600 baud userport-based RS232 interface;
@item
by emulating a 6551-based RS232 interface located at $DE00.

It is possible to define up to two UNIX serial devices, and then decide
which interface should be connected to which device.  Devices are
defined through the following settings:

@itemize @bullet
@item
``Serial 1 device@dots{}'' and ``Serial 2 device@dots{}'' are used to specify
the the pathnames of the serial devices, with the file selector;

thus are not present in the other emulators.

@node VIC20 cartridges, VIC20 memory expansions, VIC20-specific, VIC20-specific
@subsection Using cartridge images

As with the C64 (@pxref{C64 cartridges}), it is possible to attach
several types of cartridge images:

@itemize @bullet
@item
4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $2000;
@item
4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $6000;
@item
4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $A000;
@item
4 Kbyte cartridges located at $B000.
@end itemize

This can all be done via the ``Attach cartridge image@dots{}'' command in
the left-button menu.  It is also possible to let XVIC ``guess'' the
type of cartridge using ``Smart-attach cartridge image@dots{}''.

Notice that several cartridges are actually made up of two pieces (and
two files), that need to be loaded separately at different addresses.
In that case, you have to know the addresses (which are usually
specified in the file name) and use the ``attach'' command twice.


@node VIC20 memory expansions, VIC20 system ROM settings, VIC20 cartridges, VIC20-specific
@subsection Changing memory configuration

It is possible to change the VIC20 memory configuration in two ways: by
enabling and/or disabling certain individual memory blocks, or by
choosing one among a few typical memory configurations.  The former can
be done by modifying resource values directly or from the right-button
menu; the latter can only be done from the menu.

There are 5 RAM expansion blocks in the VIC20, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 and
5:

@itemize @bullet
@item
block 0 (3 Kbytes at $0400-$0FFF);
@item
block 1 (8 Kbytes at $2000-$3FFF);
@item
block 2 (8 Kbytes at $4000-$5FFF);
@item
block 3 (8 Kbytes at $6000-$7FFF);
@item
block 5 (8 Kbytes at $A000-$BFFF).
@end itemize

These blocks are called @dfn{expansion blocks} because they are not
present a stock (``unexpanded'') machine.  Each of them is associated to
a boolean @code{RamBlockX} resource (where @code{X} is the block number)
that specifies whether the block is enabled or not.

There are also some common memory configurations you can pick from the
right-button menu:

@itemize @bullet
@item
no RAM expansion blocks at all;
@item
all RAM expansion blocks enabled;
@item
3K expansion (only block 0 is enabled);
@item
8K expansion (only block 1 is enabled);
@item
16K expansion (only blocks 1 and 2 are enabled);
@item
24K expansion (only blocks 1, 2 and 3 are enabled).
@end itemize

As with the X64 (@pxref{C64 I/O extension settings}), it is also
possible to enable a special emulator identification mechanism that uses
certain memory locations to let a running program query information
about the emulator itself; this is enabled by the ``Emulator
identification'' option.

@item
@code{none} (no extension);
@item
@code{all} (all blocks);
@item
@code{3k} (3k space in block 0);
@item
@code{8k} (first 8k extension block);
@item
@code{16k} (first and second 8k extension blocks);
@item
@code{24k} (first, second and 3rd extension blocks);
@item
@code{0}, @code{1}, @code{2}, @code{3}, @code{5} (memory in respective
blocks);
@item

respective address.
@end itemize

For example,

@example
xvic -memory none
@end example

gives an unexpanded VIC20.  While

@example
xvic -memory 60,a0

or

@example
xvic -memory 3,5

@chapter Monitor

Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be used
to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as well
as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using the
``Activate monitor'' command (left button menu).  Notice that you have
to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as
@code{rxvt} or @code{xterm}) in order to use the monitor.

@b{Warning}: this version of the monitor is still under construction,
and some of the features are not fully working yet.

@table @samp

@item address_space
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of registers.
This can be the addresses available to the computer's processor, the
disk drive's processor or a specific memory configuration of one of the
mentioned processors.

@item register
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

@item address
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

@item address_range
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the range
is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both addresses must be in
the same address space.

@item address_opt_range
An address or an address range.

@c @item label
@c Fixme.

@item prompt
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second part of
the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

@item checkpoint
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an action
when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types of checkpoints;
breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

@item breakpoint
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
triggered, the monitor is entered.

@item tracepoint
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

@item watchpoint
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.  When a
watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

@item <...>
A data type.

@item *
Zero or more occurrences.

@item [...]
An optional argument.

@table @code

@item goto <address>
Change the PC to address and continue execution.

@item io
Nothing yet.  Will display VIC/VIA/CIA/SID registers.

@item next [<count>]
Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as
a single instruction.

@item registers [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]
Assign respective registers.  With no parameters, display register values.

@item return
Continues execution  and returns to the monitor just
before(after?) the next RTS or RTI is executed.

@item step [<count>]
Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows stepping more
than a single instruction at a time.

@c @item up
@c Nothing yet.  Is this really useful?

@table @code

@item compare <address_range> <address>
Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to the
destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.  Any
values that miscompare are displayed using the default displaytype.

@item fill <address_range> <data_list>
Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
<data_list>.  If the size of the address range is greater than the size
of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

@item hunt <address_range> <data_list>
Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
<data_list>.  If the data is found, the starting address of the match is
displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible matches.

@item i <address_opt_range>
Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

@item m [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]
Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the default is
used.  If only one address is specified, the length of data displayed is
based on the datatype.  If no addresses are given, the 'dot' address is
used.

@item mc [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]
Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one address
is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no addresses are
given, the ``dot'' address is used.

@item ms [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]
Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one address is
specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no addresses are given, the
``dot'' address is used.

@item move <address_range> <address>
Move memory from the source specified by the address range to
the destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

@item > [<address>] <data_list>
Write the specified data at @code{address}.

@node Assembly commands, Checkpoint commands, Memory commands, Monitor
@section Assembly commands

@table @code

@item a <address> [ <instruction> [: <instruction>]* ]
Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one instruction
is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line to exit assembly
mode).

@item d [<address> [<address>]]
Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they are used
as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it is treated as
the start address and a default number of instructions are
disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a default number of
instructions are disassembled from the dot address.

@end table

@node Checkpoint commands, General commands, Assembly commands, Monitor
@section Checkpoint commands


@table @code

@item break [<address> [if <cond_expr>] ]
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid checkpoints
are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is set for that
address and the breakpoint number is printed.  A conditional expression
can also be specified for the breakpoint.  For more information on
conditions, see the CONDITION command.

@item enable <checknum>
@item disable <checknum>
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows changing
between these states.

@item command <checknum> "<command>"
When checkpoint @code{checknum} is hit, the specified command is executed by
the monitor.  Note that the @code{x} command is not yet supported as a
command argument.

@item condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the expression,
the values used are those at the time the checkpoint is examined, not
when the condition is set.

@item delete <checknum>
Delete the specified checkpoint.

@item ignore <checknum> [<count>]
Ignore a checkpoint a given number of crossings.  If no count is given,
the default value is 1.

@item trace [address [address]]
This command is similar to the @code{break} command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint by not
stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the user an
execution trace.  The second optional address can be used to specify the
end of an range of addresses to be traced.

@item watch [address [address]]
This command is similar to the previous two commands except that it
operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from the others by
stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of addresses.  If
no addresses are given, a list of all the watchpoints is printed.

Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
argument, the current radix is printed.

@item sidefx [on|off|toggle]
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that have
read side-effects.  If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause
side-effects.  If the argument is 'off' then reads don't cause
side-effects.  If the argument is 'toggle' then the current mode is

@chapter c1541

VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called @code{c1541}.  You can either invoke it from the command
line or from within one of the VICE emulators, using the ``Run c1541''
command which will open a new @code{xterm} window with a running
@code{c1541} in it.

The syntax is:

@example
c1541 OPTIONS IMAGE
@end example

If some @code{OPTIONS} but no @code{IMAGE} are specified, @code{c1541}
runs in batch mode; otherwise, it attaches the @code{IMAGE} if present
and enters interactive mode, where you can type commands that are
executed when you press Enter (abbreviations are allowed).  As with the
monitor, file name completion and command line editing with history are
provided via GNU @code{readline}.  Use the command @samp{quit} to exit.

Notice that @code{c1541} always creates @code{X64} files, but can read
and write @code{D64} and @code{T64} files automatically, without the
need for any special options.

@chapter Acknowledgments

VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X Window
System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were mostly involved
in the development of X64 and VICE:

The VICE core team:

@itemize @bullet
@c The Texinfo manual says we should not use @b though!

@item
@b{Ettore Perazzoli} (@email{ettore@@comm2000.it})
made the 6510, VIC-II, VIC-I and CRTC emulations, part of the
hardware-level 1541 emulation, speed optimizations, bug fixes,
the event-driven cycle-exact engine, the Xt/Xaw/Xfwf-based GUI for X11, a
general code reorganization, the new resource handling, most of the
documentation and the MS-DOS port (well, somebody had to do it).

@item
@b{Teemu Rantanen} (@email{tvr@@cs.hut.fi})
implemented the SID emulation and the trap-based disk drive and serial bus
implementation; added support for multiple display depths under X11.

@item
@b{Andr@'e Fachat} (@email{fachat@@physik.tu-chemnitz.de})
wrote the PET emulators, the CIA and VIA emulation, the IEEE488
interface, implemented the IEC serial bus in @code{xvic} and made tons
of bug fixes.

@item
@b{Daniel Sladic} (@email{sladic@@eecg.toronto.edu})
started the work on hardware-level 1541 emulation and wrote the
new monitor introduced with VICE 0.15.

@item
@b{Andreas Boose} (@email{boose@@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de})
gave lots of information and bug reports about the VIC-II, the 6510 and
the CIAs; moreover, he wrote several test-routines that were used to
improve the emulation.  Also contributed some important patches, fixed
several problems in the 1541 emulation, implemented the SpeedDOS parallel
cable emulation and added cartridge support.

@section VICE home page

You can find the latest news about VICE at the official VICE
home page:

@example
@uref{http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fachat/vice/vice.html}
@end example

Also the public patches and beta releases will be available there as
well, so you might want to have a look at it periodically.  If you are
going to report a bug, please check those pages @emph{first}; it is
possible that the problem you encountered has already been fixed with a
newer version.

@section How to send feedback

If you want to report bugs, make suggestions or contribute to
the project, please email one of the following people:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Teemu Rantanen (@email{tvr@@cs.hut.fi}) for the SID stuff;

@item
Andreas Boose (@email{boose@@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de}) for the 1541
disk drive;

@item
Andr@'e Fachat (@email{fachat@@physik.tu-chemnitz.de}) for the PETs;

@item
Ettore Perazzoli (@email{ettore@@comm2000.it}), the current
maintainer, for everything else.

@end itemize

It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE, but
please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the
team.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Please put the word @samp{VICE} @emph{in all capitals} in your subject
line (e.g. @samp{VICE fails to run game XXX}).  This helps mail
splitting and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally
deleted, forgotten or lost.

@item
Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you use
M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off the
"rich text" (HTML) feature.

@item
Please don't send @emph{any} binaries without asking first.

@item
Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a bug
or a problem you cannot solve:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);
@item
the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable from the
VICE home page:
@uref{http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fachat/vice/vice.html});
@item
the @code{comp.emulators.cbm} and @code{comp.sys.cbm} FAQs (@pxref{FAQs
you should read}).
@end itemize

@item
When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should also
tell us what machine you are running on, what operating system you are
using as well as the version of it.

@item
Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to your
PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.  To transfer
disks, you can use the Star Commander
(@uref{http://ludens.elte.hu/~sta/sc.html}).  And no, you cannot read
C64 disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

@item
Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
Internet.

@item
Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
really don't know.

@item
Please write in English, or in the language of the person you
are writing to (Ettore is Italian, Andr@'e and Andreas are German,
Teemu is Finnish, Daniel is from Canada).

@end itemize

In any case, we would be @emph{really} glad to receive your comments
about VICE.

Thanks!


@node Contributing, Newsgroups, Sending feedback, Contacts
@section How to contribute

If you want to make a major contribution, please @emph{ask} first.  It
has already happened a couple of times that somebody started working at
something that had already been done but not released to the public yet,
and we really do @emph{not} want anybody to waste time.

If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is relative
to the very latest version, and provide us with the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
a diff file containing all the changes you have made (@samp{diff -c} or
@samp{diff -u} (better) is fine; please don't use plain @samp{diff});
@item
GNU-style @file{ChangeLog} entries with a description of the changes you
have made (look at the @file{ChangeLog}s provided with the original VICE
sources for an example).
@end itemize

This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother and
safer.

People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always welcome.  A
Windows and a MacOS port are in the works, so if you are interested in
those platforms, please let us know.  There is plenty of work to do and
any sort of help can be very useful.


@node Newsgroups, FAQs you should read, Contributing, Contacts
@section Interesting newsgroups

There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{comp.emulators.cbm}, discussing about emulators of Commodore 8-bit
machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

@item
@code{comp.sys.cbm}, discussing various topics regarding real Commodore
8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people who actually use
original Commodore equipment (so please don't talk about emulation
here).

@item
@code{comp.emulators.misc}, discussing emulators in general.

@end itemize

@node FAQs you should read,  , Newsgroups, Contacts
@section FAQs you should read

We recommend reading the @code{comp.emulators.cbm} and
@code{comp.sys.cbm} FAQs, which are posted regularly on the
corresponding newsgroups and are also available via FTP from
@uref{ftp://rtfm.mit.edu}.
