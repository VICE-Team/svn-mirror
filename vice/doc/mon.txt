COMMAND: add_label
ABBREVIATIONS: al
SYNTAX: add_label <address> <label>

during disassembly.
 TODO: Allow label to specify address in commands.


COMMAND: assemble

FUNCTION: Assemble instructions to the specified address.
If more than one instruction is given, the command does not
cause the monitor to enter assembly mode.

FUNCTION: None yet.


COMMAND: block read
ABBREVIATIONS: none
SYNTAX: br <track> <sector> [<address>]

memory. If no address is given, the data is displayed on the 
screen using the default datatype.

FUNCTION: This command writes a block of data at address
to the specified track and sector. 


COMMAND: set or list breakpoints
ABBREVIATIONS: none
SYNTAX: break [<address> [if <cond_expr>] ]

FUNCTION: This command allows setting a breakpoint or
listing the current breakpoints. If no address is given,
the currently valid checkpoints are printed. If an address
is given, a breakpoint is set for that address and the
breakpoint number is printed. A conditional expression can
also be specified for the breakpoint. For more information
on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

FUNCTION: Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the
condition is evaluated. If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint
is activated. Otherwise, it is ignores. If registers are specified
in the expression, the values used are those at the time the
checkpoint is examined, not when the condition is set.
 TODO: Add memory dereferencing.
