Binary Distribution:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The binary distribution script now requires that MacPorts be used for
dependencies. MacPorts can be configured to compile for older versions of macOS.

1. Make sure Xcode 10 or earlier is active, otherwise the .app files created by
   platypus will require macOS 10.11. You can use xcode-select to choose which
   Xcode.app is the active one.

2. Install platypus, which is used to generate .app wrappers:

   $ sudo port install platypus

3. Follow macOS-Howto.txt to get a MacPorts VICE build environment working.

4. Bundled dependencies need to be rebuilt to target macOS 10.9. First, set
   macosx_deployment_target to 10.9 in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf.

   I usually then nuke all installed ports and start again with runtime deps
   built from source, like this:

   $ sudo port uninstall installed
   $ sudo port -s install gtk3 +quartz
   $ sudo port -s install libsdl2 xa lame glew
   $ sudo port install rust cargo
   $ sudo port -s install librsvg
   $ sudo port install adwaita-icon-theme texinfo texlive-basic ffmpeg

   But that is probably overkill and you wont want to do this if you have other
   use of MacPorts on your system. You might be able to find a lighter way,
   perhaps something like:

   $ sudo port uninstall $(port rdeps gtk3 | sed 1d)
   $ sudo port uninstall gtk3
   $ sudo port -s install gtk3 +quartz

4. Now build VICE against the reinstalled dependencies, and make the bindist:

   $ cd <build folder>

   SDL2:
   $ <path to VICE source>/configure \
       --enable-sdlui2 \
       --enable-lame \
       --enable-arch=no
   
   Gtk3:
   $ <path to VICE source>/configure \
       --enable-native-gtk3ui \
       --enable-lame \
       --enable-arch=no

   $ make clean
   $ make -j
   $ make bindistzip

   Gtk3 is built without hwscale at the moment due to a bug where fullscreen
   mode only shows a portion of the screen.

   At some point soon it would be good to build with --enable-external-ffmpeg,
   but without including the dylibs in the bindary distribution and rely on
   locally installed version of ffmpeg. This works, however the app currently
   segfaults if it doesn't find the libs somewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Codesigning and notarising:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Without codesigning, all versions of macOS will complain when you install
and launch. Without notarising, it's a huge pain the arse to try and run
the builds on macOS 10.15 Catalina. You'll need an Apple developer ID for
codesigning, and a paid up Apple developer subscription to make a notarised
build. Sorry :(

1. Find your code signing ids:

   $ security find-identity -v -p codesigning

   You are looking for something like:
   "Developer ID Application: David Hogan (3RAEHPQQ6Z)"

2. 'make bindist(zip)' will now code sign everything if the CODE_SIGN_ID
   environment variable is set:

   $ export CODE_SIGN_ID="<Your code signing id>"
   $ make bindistzip

3. Follow Apple steps for notarisation at the URL below. If your Apple ID
   belongs to more than one team, you'll need to use the --asc-provider
   argument when you xcrun altool. You can xcode-select back to Xcode 11
   so that you can xcrun altool --list-providers to find the right id to
   use.

   See below for the notarisation script that I wrote the to automate the
   notarisation process for the offical VICE dmg files.

NOTARISATION_PASSWORD="<a single app password for your apple ID>"
NOTARISATION_PROVIDER="<your asc provider, see below>"

#
# You don't need the --asc-provider part if your apple ID is only in one team.
#

# verify that the signing looks ok
codesign -vvv --deep --strict "$1"

xcrun altool --notarize-app \
             --primary-bundle-id "$1" \
             --username "$APPLE_ID_EMAIL" \
             --password "$NOTARISATION_PASSWORD" \
             --asc-provider "$NOTARISATION_PROVIDER" \
             --file "$1" \
             2>&1 | tee "$OUTPUT"
UUID=$(awk '/RequestUUID/ { print $3 }' "$OUTPUT")

if [ -z "$UUID" ]
then
    echo "ERROR: Failed to capture RequestUUID from xcrun output".
    exit 1
fi

echo "Waiting for Status: success"

while [ -z "$(grep "Status: success" "$OUTPUT")" ]
do
    sleep 10
    xcrun altool --notarization-info "$UUID" \
                 -u "$APPLE_ID_EMAIL" \
                 -p "$NOTARISATION_PASSWORD" \
                 2>&1 | tee "$OUTPUT"
done

xcrun stapler staple "$1"
