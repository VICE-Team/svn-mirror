Building the SDL port of VICE
-----------------------------

VICE can link against either SDL1 or SDL2 depending on how it is
configured. Despite being different versions of the "same library",
they are neither API nor binary compatible and connot be
simultaneously linked. You will need to pick one to use.

Generally speaking, if SDL2 is available on your target system, that
is the build you want -- SDL2 provides more efficient use of modern OS
facilities with fewer external dependencies required. SDL1 is really
useful only if:

- You are building for a system without graphical acceleration of any
  kind or for a system with graphical acceleration but which is
  difficult or finicky to use (like the default Raspberry Pi setup).
- SDL2 isn't available on your system at all (BeOS, RISC OS,
  etc). OpenGL will be available if the platform supports it.


Building in *nix compile enviroments
------------------------------------

If you have checked out the unstable svn version of VICE you need to generate
the configure script first by doing:
./autogen.sh

The stable tarball already has the configure script, so continue with:

./configure --enable-sdlui2
make
make install

You'll need the SDL2 libs and headers. Movie recording needs the
FFMPEG libraries and headers.

To build SDL1, pass --enable-sdlui to configure instead of --enable-sdlui2,
and you will need OpenGL headers and libraries as well if you want free-scaling.

Steps to set up the needed external SDL libs for building using with minGW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You will need to download the current version of SDL headers and libs for minGW. 
   They can be found here https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz
2. Locate your minGW install include directory (ex. C:\MinGW\include), and
   create a directory called SDL there (ex. C:\MinGW\include\SDL). Inside this
   directory, copy all your SDL header (.h) files extracted in the SDL 'include' 
   directory from step #1
3. Locate your minGW library directory (ex. C:\MinGW\lib). Inside this directory, 
   copy all your SDL libs (.a) files extracted into the SDL 'lib' directory from step #1
4. Follow the standard build instructions for *nix environment now
5. After making, type 'make bindist' to create the binary distribution files. They 
   will appear in a newly created SDLVICE directory. 

NOTE: The default SDL build does not statically link the mingw and sdl runtime libs, 
so you will need to locate and copy the SDL.dll from found in step #1 and the minGW 
libstdc++.dll & libgcc.dll files from the minGW (ex. C:\MinGW\bin) directory to a global
windows path (ex. \WINDOWS\system32) or you can just drop them in the local SDLVICE 
binary dir so they can be found during runtime.

TODO: Update these instructions for MSYS2 and SDL2.

Building on macOS
-----------------
Building on Mac requires a number of preconditions for best results.

Due to Apple's deprecation of OpenGL in 10.14, we recommend using SDL2
exclusively on macOS. SDL2 includes a native Metal-based backend that
should ensure some level of future-proofing. In the meantime, it also
transparently uses OpenGL on legacy systems.

We also recommend that third-party package managers such as Brew or
MacPorts not be present on your build system. These package managers
tend to interfere with command-line-based compilation and linkage of
projects that are intended to be wholly self-contained.

The build scripts for VICE require macOS 10.9 Mavericks or later -
this is the earliest version of macOS that includes the C++ runtime
present on contemporary Macs.

The only external requirement strictly needed is the SDL2 framework.
Download it from https://www.libsdl.org, and install it in some
directory. For the purposes of these instructions, we will assume you
copy the framework into ~/Frameworks.

Once that has been done, a .dmg may be built by executing the following commands:

./autogen.sh
FW_DIR=~/Frameworks ./configure --enable-sdlui2 --enable-arch=no
make
make bindistzip

TODO: Update instructions for readline, ffmpeg, etc. etc. as needed.



Building on Windows with MSYS2
==============================

To build the SDL version on Windows, we use the MinGW toolchain as provided by
the MSYS2 project: https://www.msys2.org/

We'll be using the x86_64 version in this guide, and we'll install it into
C:\opt\msys64. So download and install the lastest x86_64 installer and follow
the instructions on the msys2 website.
MSYS2 shell commands will be indicated with '$' from now on.


Install development packages
----------------------------

After installing the msys2 base system we need a "few" more packages, so:

$ pacboy sync base-devel: pkg-config gcc ntldd zip: subversion: SDL2 libpng

Select 'all' for the base-devel group, then proceed to install a few packages,
perhaps grab a beer, have some coffee or tea while msys2 does its magic.

Now we need the xa assembler to build the VSID driver, which isn't in the MSYS2
repo, so we'll build it ourselves:

$ wget https://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/dists/xa-2.3.10.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf xa-2.3.10.tar.gz
$ cd xa-2.3.10
$ make
$ make install
$ cd ~


Check out VICE via SVN and create a minimal SDL2 build
------------------------------------------------------

$ svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/trunk vice-trunk

(If you need write access to SVN, you'll need to install openssh and check out
 trunk with the svn+ssh protocol)

Change to the vice dir and see if we can build the SDL2 VICE UI:

$ cd vice-trunk/vice
# Generate the required build system files, such as configure:
$ ./autogen.sh

Now let's try to configure a minimal working SDL2 build:

$ ./configure --enable-sdlui2
(This will take a while on Windows, be patient)

Once this passes succesfully, we can try to actually build SDL2-VICE:

$ make
(Or, to collect any warnings during building: make 2>&1 | tee build.log)

Once this succesfully finishes, we can try to run x64sc:

# Create a temorary dir with the files needed for x64sc (ROMs, keymaps, palette
# files, etc):
$ mkdir ~/alldata-c64
$ cp data/C64/* ~/alldata-c64
$ cp data/DRIVES/* ~/alldata-c64

Now run x64sc using this directory for the data files:
$ src/x64sc -directory ~/alldata-c64

If that works, building SDL2-VICE worked!


Creating a proper install
-------------------------

Now we can create a proper directory with all required files:
$ make bindist

If you see a warning about binaries being optimized for your system: if you
won't redistribute your bindist then all is fine, if you do plan to
redistribute, than you should pass --enable-arch=no to ./configure. (In that
case you'll have to do a make clean first to make sure the new configure switch
is properly used to rebuild all object files)

Now start cmd.exe and CD into the bindist dir:

$ cd \opt\msys64\home\compyx\vice-trunk\vice\SDL2VICE-3.4-win64-r37378
# (Obviously alter the above to match your path)
$ x64sc
# Maybe test a few others, for example xpet:
$ xpet

If this works you can copy the SDL2VICE-3.* dir to where you want it and rename
it if required. For example copy/movce it to C:\opt\vice-sdl2 and update your
Windows' $PATH to contain 'C:\opt\vice-sdl2'


Adding features (TODO)
----------------------

* building documentation (set up and use MikTeX)
* network support (pcap)
* screenshot support (jpeg, gif)
