- Xaw UI context popup menu for drive attach is broken if more than
  two drives are active.

- Screenshots with activated PAL emulation do not deliver the expected
  (blurry) result. 

- Some basic features of the VDC are missing. In the MS-DOS port you
  have to save the configuration and restart the emulator when
  changing VDC double size mode.

- In the C128 emulation VIC-II and VDC palette can not coexist
  currently in some ports.

- The VIC-II implementation lacks cycle exact sprite collision
  support.  Also in NTSC mode some lines are missing at the bottom of
  the screen.

- The 2MHz mode of the C128 is not supported.

- The CBM-II emulation is not fully supported in all ports.

- When loading a snapshot, the monitor break/watchpoints break.
  (at least in xpet)

- The Linux/DGA2 code is known to be unstable, especially when
  switching back to window mode under some circumstances.
  DGA2 shows strange keyboard behavior (shifted keys sometimes do not
  work) with certain XFree drivers (e.g. NVIDIA drivers).
  The code won't be improved significantly by the current author
  (deprecated). 
      
- The Linux/DGA1 and Linux/VIDMODE fullscreen support may be unstable
  on some systems. Double size/scan does not work currenty.

- openGL sync is not well integrated in the current vsync code -
  switching back and forth xrandr fullscreen when openGL sync is
  activated might lead to strange vsync behavior; ie. very long time
  until 100% and decent fps rate is reached again.
  To avoid this deactivate openGL sync before leaving or entering
  fullscreen modes.

- Gnome2: enabling double size no longer resizes the canvas
  window. This is intentional and the user is obliged to resize the
  window to the desired size.
  Any suggestions to automate enlarging AND shrinking to the proper
  canvas window needs are appreciated (non HW scaling support).

- Xaw/XRandR fullscreen doesn't maximize the window automatically; for
  some reason the window manager hint is ignored. See also comment in 
  src/arch/unix/x11/xaw/x11ui.c:1443.

- The Image preview does not make use of CBM font in the Gnome2 port.

- The custom TextField widget is buggy and can cause crashes on
  DEC/Alpha machines, and possibly on other systems too.  If you get
  weird X protocol errors or the file selector makes the emulator die
  when you close it, this might be the cause.  In that case, recompile
  with the `--disable-textfield' option.  If it still does not work,
  please tell us.

- Some DEC/Alpha machines crash due to the XAW implementation.
  Compile VICE with GNOME support `--enable-gnomeui' instead.

- When a key which is shifted on the real machine but unshifted on the
  PC or Unix keyboard you are using is pressed, the virtual shift is
  pressed together (i.e. at the same clock cycle) with the main key;
  this could not work with some keyboard routines.  If you have to
  use the function keys, press the (real) shift key manually (e.g. F2
  = Shift + F1, F4 = Shift + F3 and so on); this also works with other
  keys.

- The CBM-II emulator, when the execution bank is set to an open
  memory bank, sets the zeropage and stack access to unmapped, but
  actually existing memory. This is a bug but cannot be avoided with
  the current CPU code architecture.

- When running the burn-in and diagnostics test of the 8296 system
  disk on "xpet -model 8296" a lot of stuff fails.

- Although both are emulated in the xcbm2 emulator, switching between
  C510 and C6x0/7x0 is not possible at runtime. Use command line
  option "xcbm -model 510".

- Dual disk drive 2040/3040 support (DOS1, 670 blocks free) is not
  working 

- In the C510 emulation the VIC-II timing is not exact, i.e. the
  stopping of the CPU during bad lines is wrong.

- Snapshots are not supported by the plus4 emulation.

- Using X11 XAW it is not possible to enter the disk name in the
  create empty disc image dialog.
