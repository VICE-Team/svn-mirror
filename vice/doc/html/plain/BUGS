- IRQ acknowledge handling is buggy. Visible in e.g.
  Charlatan/Beyond Force, Enforcer, Bandits (VIC20).

- Xaw UI context popup menu for drive attach is broken if more than
  two drives are active.

- Screenshots with activated PAL emulation do not deliver the expected
  (blurry) result. 

- Some basic features of the VDC are missing. In the MS-DOS port you
  have to save the configuration and restart the emulator when
  changing VDC double size mode.

- In the C128 emulation VIC-II and VDC palette can not coexist
  currently in some ports.

- The VIC-II implementation lacks cycle exact sprite collision
  support.  Also in NTSC mode some lines are missing at the bottom of
  the screen.

- The CBM-II emulation is not fully supported in all ports.

- When loading a snapshot, the monitor break/watchpoints break.
  (at least in xpet)

- The custom TextField widget is buggy and can cause crashes on
  DEC/Alpha machines, and possibly on other systems too.  If you get
  weird X protocol errors or the file selector makes the emulator die
  when you close it, this might be the cause.  In that case, recompile
  with the `--disable-textfield' option.  If it still does not work,
  please tell us.

- Some DEC/Alpha machines crash due to the XAW implementation.
  Compile VICE with GNOME support `--enable-gnomeui' instead.

- When a key which is shifted on the real machine but unshifted on the
  PC or Unix keyboard you are using is pressed, the virtual shift is
  pressed together (i.e. at the same clock cycle) with the main key;
  this could not work with some keyboard routines.  If you have to
  use the function keys, press the (real) shift key manually (e.g. F2
  = Shift + F1, F4 = Shift + F3 and so on); this also works with other
  keys.

- The CBM-II emulator, when the execution bank is set to an open
  memory bank, sets the zeropage and stack access to unmapped, but
  actually existing memory. This is a bug but cannot be avoided with
  the current CPU code architecture.

- When running the burn-in and diagnostics test of the 8296 system
  disk on "xpet -model 8296" a lot of stuff fails.

- Although both are emulated in the xcbm2 emulator, switching between
  C510 and C6x0/7x0 is not possible at runtime. Use command line
  option "xcbm -model 510".

- Dual disk drive 2040/3040 support (DOS1, 670 blocks free) is not
  working 

- In the C510 emulation the VIC-II timing is not exact, i.e. the
  stopping of the CPU during bad lines is wrong.

- Snapshots are not supported by the plus4 emulation.

- Using X11 XAW it is not possible to enter the disk name in the
  create empty disc image dialog.

- In the win32 port keyboard input can be garbled after issuing a
  reset on CPU JAM.

- Commandline `-logfile SOME/FILE.log' fails to record logs to 
  `SOME/FILE.log' when resources are loaded via menu (load settings).
