<H1><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC20">4  System files</A></H1>

<P>
In order to work properly, the emulators need to load a few system
files:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

the <EM>system ROMs</EM>, raw binary files containing copies of the original ROMs
of the machine you are emulating;

<P> <LI>

the <EM>keyboard maps</EM>, text files describing the keyboard layout;

<P> <LI>

the <EM>palette files</EM>, text files describing the colors of the machine you
are emulating.

</UL> </P>

<P>
The place where they will be searched for depends on the value of the
<CODE>Directory</CODE> resource, which is a colon (<CODE>;</CODE>)-separated search
path list, like the UNIX <CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable.  The
default value is

</P>

<PRE>
PREFIX/lib/vice/EMU:BOOTPATH/EMU
</PRE>

<P>
Where <CODE>PREFIX</CODE> is the installation prefix (usually
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>), <CODE>EMU</CODE> is the name of the emulated machine
(<CODE>C64</CODE>, <CODE>C128</CODE>, <CODE>PET</CODE> or <CODE>VIC20</CODE>) and
<CODE>BOOTPATH</CODE> is the directory where the executable resides.

</P>
<P>
For example, if you have the C64 emulator installed in

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/bin/x64
</PRE>

<P>
then the value will be

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64;/usr/local/bin/C64
</PRE>

<P>
And system files will be searched for under the following directories,
in the specified order:

</P>

<P> <OL>
<P> <LI>

<CODE>/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64</CODE>
<P> <LI>

<CODE>/usr/local/bin/C64</CODE>
</OL> </P>

<P>
System files can still be installed in a different directory if you
specify a complete path instead of just a file name.  For example, if
you specify <TT>`./kernal'</TT> as the kernal image name, the kernal image
will be loaded from the current directory.  This can be done by using
command-line options or by modifying resource values (see section <A HREF="vice_6.html#SEC36">6.1  Format of resource files</A>).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC21">4.1  ROM files</A></H2>

<P>
Every emulator requires its own ROM set.  For the VIC20 and the C64, the
ROM set consists in the following files:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<TT>`kernal'</TT>,  the Kernal ROM (8 KBytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`basic'</TT>, the Basic ROM (8 KBytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`chargen'</TT>, the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`dos1541'</TT>, the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

</UL> </P>

<P>
The C128 needs the following files instead:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<TT>`kernal'</TT>, the Kernal ROM (8 Kbytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`basic'</TT>, the BASIC + Editor ROM (32 Kbytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`chargen'</TT>, the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`dos1541'</TT>, the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

</UL> </P>

<P>
The PET emulator uses a quite different setup instead: the Basic and
Kernal ROMS are packed into a single file and only three kernal files
are provided; one for each basic revision.  To handle the different
screen sizes and keyboards, different so-called "editor-ROMs" for the
memory range $E000-$E800 are provided.  The kernal files contain an
editor ROM for 40 columns and graphics keyboard already.  The PET ROMs
have the following names:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<TT>`pet2001'</TT>, the PET2001 Basic 1 + Kernal ROM (16 KBytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`pet3032'</TT>, the PET3032 Basic 2 + Kernal ROM (16 KBytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`pet4032'</TT>, the PET4032/8032 Basic 4 + Kernal ROM (20
KBytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`edit2.b'</TT>, the PET3032 editor for business keyboard (2
KBytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`edit4.b40'</TT>, the PET4032 editor for business keyboard
(2 KBytes)

<P> <LI>

<TT>`edit4.b80'</TT>, the PET8032 editor for 80 columns and
business keyboard (2 KBytes)

</UL> </P>

<P>
The PETs also have sockets for extension ROMs for the addresses
$9000-$9FFF, $A000-$AFFF and $B000-$BFFF (the last one for PET2001 and
PET3032 only).  You can specify ROM image files for those extensions
command line options <CODE>-petrom9</CODE>, <CODE>-petromA</CODE> and
<CODE>-petromB</CODE> resp.

</P>
<P>
An alternative would be to specify a long kernal ROM with the
<CODE>-kernal</CODE> option that includes the extension ROM areas already.

</P>
<P>
Also, you can specify a replacement for the basic ROM at $B000-$DFFF
with the <CODE>-petromBasic</CODE> option and a replacement for the editor ROM
at $E000-$E7FF with the <CODE>-petromEditor</CODE> option.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC22">4.2  Keymap files</A></H2>

<P>
<EM>Keymap files</EM> are used to define the keyboard layout, defining what
key (or combination of keys) must me mapped to ever keysym.

</P>
<P>
In other words, the keyboard emulation works like this: whenever the
user presses o releases a key while the input focus in the emulation
window, the emulator receives an X-Window event with a value that
identifies that key.  That value is called a <EM>keysym</EM> and is unique
to that key.  Then the emulator looks for that keysym into an internal
table which tells it what key(s) to press or release on the emulated
keyboard.

</P>
<P>
This table is described by the keymap file, which is made up of lines
like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
KEYSYM ROW COLUMN SHIFTFLAG
</PRE>

<P>
Where:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<CODE>KEYSYM</CODE> is a string identifying the keysym: you can use the
<CODE>xev</CODE> utility (shipped with the X Window system) to see what keysym
is bound to any key;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>ROW</CODE> and <CODE>COLUMN</CODE> identify the key on the emulated keyboard;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>SHIFTFLAG</CODE> can have one of the following values:


<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<CODE>0</CODE>: the key is never shifted;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>1</CODE>: the key is shifted;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>2</CODE>: the key is the left shift;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>4</CODE>: the key is the right shift;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>8</CODE>: the key can be (optionally) shifted by the user.

</UL> </P>

</UL> </P>

<P>
The <CODE>SHIFTFLAG</CODE> is useful if you want certain keys to be
"artificially" shifted by the emulator, and not by the user.  For
example, <KBD>F2</KBD> is shifted on the C64 keyboard, but you might want it
to be mapped to the unshifted <KBD>F2</KBD> key on the PC keyboard.  To do
so, you just have to use a line like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
F2 0 4 1
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>4</CODE> identify the key (row 0, column 4 on the
keyboard matrix), and <CODE>1</CODE> specifies that every time the user presses
<KBD>F2</KBD> the shift key on the C64 keyboard must be pressed.

</P>
<P>
There are also some special commands you can put into the keyboard file;
they are recognized because they start with an exclamation mark:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<CODE>!CLEAR</CODE> clears the currently loaded keyboard map; it is
necessary to put this at the beginning of the file if you want the
keymap file to override all of the current internal settings;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>!LSHIFT</CODE>, <CODE>!RSHIFT</CODE>, followed by a row and a column
value, specify where the left and right shift keys are located on the
emulated keyboard; for example, C64 default keymaps will specify


<PRE>
!LSHIFT 1 7
!RSHIFT 6 4
</PRE>

</UL> </P>

<P>
Any line starting with the <CODE>#</CODE> sign, instead, is completely
ignored.  This is useful for adding comments within the keymap file.

</P>
<P>
VICE keymap files have the <TT>`.vkm'</TT> default extension, and every
emulator comes with a default positional mapping and a default symbolic
mapping.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC23">4.3  Palette files</A></H2>

<P>
<EM>Palette files</EM> are used to specify the colors used in the
emulators.  They are made up of lines like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
RED GREEN BLUE DITHER
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>RED</CODE>, <CODE>GREEN</CODE> and <CODE>BLUE</CODE> are hexadecimal values
ranging from 0 to FF and specifying the amount of red, green and blue
you want for each color and <CODE>DITHER</CODE> is an hexadecimal 4-bit
number specifying the pattern you want to be used when rendering on a
B/W display.

</P>
<P>
You have to include as many lines as the number of colors the emulated
machine has, and the order of the lines must respect the one used in the
machine (so the N'th line must contain the specifications for color N -
1 in the emulated machine).

</P>
<P>
Lines starting with the <CODE>#</CODE> sign are completely ignored.  This is
useful for adding comments (such as color names) within the palette
file.

</P>
<P>
For example, the default PET palette file (which has only two colors, 0 for
background and 1 for foreground), looks like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
#
# VICE Palette file
#
# Syntax:
# Red Green Blue Dither
#

# Background
00 00 00 0

# Foreground
00 FF 00 F
</PRE>
