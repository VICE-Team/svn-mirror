<H1><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC20">5  Basic operation</A></H1>

<P>
This section describes the basic things you can do after the emulator
has been fired up.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC21">5.1  The emulation window</A></H2>

<P>
When the emulator is run, the screen of the emulated machine is
displayed in a standard X Window which we will call the <EM>emulation
window</EM>.  This window will be updated in real-time, displaying the same
contents that a real monitor or TV set would.

</P>
<P>
Under the emulation window there is an area which is used to display
information about the state of the emulator; we will call this area the
<EM>status bar</EM>.

</P>
<P>
On the extreme left of the status bar, there is a <EM>performance
meter</EM>.  The performance meter displays the current relative speed (in
percent) of the emulator and the update frequency, in frames per second.
All the machines emulated are PAL, so the update frequency will be of 50
frames per second if your system is fast enough to allow the emulator to
run at the speed of the real machine.

</P>
<P>
On the extreme right of the status bar, there is a <EM>drive status
indicator</EM>.  This is only visible if the hardware-level ("True") 1541
emulation is turned on.  In that case, the drive status indicator will
contain a rectangle which emulates the drive LED and will display the
current track position of the read-write head of the drive.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC22">5.2  Using the menus</A></H2>

<P>
It is possible to execute some commands and change emulation parameters
while running the emulator: two menus are available by pressing the
right or left mouse buttons while the pointer is in the emulation
window.  The left mouse button will open the <EM>command menu</EM> from
which several emulation-related commands can be executed; the right
mouse button will open the <EM>setting menu</EM>, from which emulation
parameters can be changed.  The basic difference between the command and
the setting menu is that, while commands have only effect on the current
session, settings can be saved for later use: this can be done with the
"Save settings" and "Load settings" right-button menu items.
"Restore default settings" restores the factory defaults.
See section <A HREF="vice_6.html#SEC30">6  Settings and resources</A> for more information about how settings
work in VICE.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes commands can be reached via <EM>shortcuts</EM> or <EM>hotkeys</EM>,
i.e. it is possible to reach them by pressing a sequence of keys instead
of going through the menu with the mouse; when this happens, the
corresponding shortcut is displayed in parenthesis on the right of the
menu item.  In VICE, all the shortcuts must begin with the <EM>right</EM>
<KBD>control</KBD> key; this happens because all the modifier keys are needed
by the emulated machine and <KBD>control</KBD> is the only key which is most
certainly duplicated on Unix keyboards (right <KBD>shift</KBD> would not be
suitable because it is used by the emulated machine too, and <KBD>alt</KBD>
or <KBD>meta</KBD> are not always duplicated).  So, for example, to attach a
disk image to drive #8 (the corresponding menu item displays "C-8"),
you have to press the right <KBD>control</KBD> key and then <KBD>8</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
Notice that, while the right <KBD>control</KBD> key is pressed, pressing
other keys has no effect at all on the emulated machine.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC23">5.3  Getting help</A></H2>

<P>
In case you suddenly get stuck or do not remember how to do a certain
thing, you can in any moment use the "Browse manuals" command (left
button menu).  This will popup a browser and open the HTML version of
this documentation.  Notice that this requires VICE to be properly (and
fully) installed with a <SAMP>`make install'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The browser can be specified via the <CODE>HTMLBrowserCommand</CODE> string
resource (see section <A HREF="vice_6.html#SEC30">6  Settings and resources</A> for information about
resources).  Every <SAMP>`%s'</SAMP> in the string will be replaced with a URL
to the VICE HTML pages.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC24">5.4  Using the file selector</A></H2>

<P>
In those situations where it is necessary to specify a file name, all
of the VICE emulators will pop up a file selector window which allows
you to select one file interactively.

</P>
<P>
On the left of the file selector, there is a list of ancestor
directories: by clicking on them, you can go up the directory tree.  On
the right, there is a list of the files in the current directory; files
can be selected by clicking on them.  If you click on a directory, that
directory becomes the current one; if you click on an ordinary file, it
becomes active.

</P>
<P>
On the top, there are a <EM>directory box</EM>, with the complete path of
the current directory, and a <EM>file name box</EM>, with the name of the
file you are selecting.  On the bottom there are two buttons: "OK"
confirms the selected file and "Cancel" abandons the file selector
without cancelling the operation.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to specify what files you want to show in the file
selector by writing an appropriate shell-like pattern in the directory
box; eg. <SAMP>`~/*.[dx]64'</SAMP> will only show files in the home directory whose
name ends with <TT>`.d64'</TT> or <TT>`*.x64'</TT>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC25">5.5  Using disk and tape images</A></H2>

<P>
The emulator is able to emulate disk drives and (read-only) tape
recorders if provided with suitable <EM>disk images</EM> or <EM>tape
images</EM>.  An <EM>image</EM> is a raw dump of the contents of the media, and
must be <EM>attached</EM> before the emulator can use it.  "Attaching" a
disk or tape image is like "virtually" inserting a diskette or a
cassette into the disk drive or the tape recorder: after an image is
attached, the emulator is able to use it as a storage media.

</P>
<P>
There are five commands (in the left button menu) that deal with disk
and tape images:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

Attach Disk Image
<P> <LI>

Detach Disk Image
<P> <LI>

Attach Tape Image
<P> <LI>

Detach Tape Image
<P> <LI>

Smart-attach a file

</UL> </P>

<P>
The first four commands are used to insert and remove the virtual disks
and cassette tapes from the respective units.  On the other hand, the
last commands tries to guess the type of the image you are attaching
from its name and size, and attaches it to the most reasonable device.

</P>
<P>
Supported formats are <CODE>D64</CODE> and <CODE>X64</CODE> for disk images (devices
8, 9 and 10) and <CODE>T64</CODE> for tape images.  Notice that <CODE>T64</CODE>
support is <EM>read-only</EM>, and that the cassette is automatically
rewound from the start when you reach the end.

</P>
<P>
Another important feature is that raw Commodore BASIC binary files and
.P00 files can be attached as tapes.  As you can autostart a
tape image when it is attached (see section <A HREF="vice_5.html#SEC27">5.5.2  "Autostarting" an image</A>), this allows you to
autostart these particular files as well.

</P>
<P>
You can attach a disk for which you do have write permissions: when this
happens, the 1541 emulator will emulate a write-protected disk.  This is
also useful if you want to preserve certain disk image from being
written to; in the latter case, just remove the write permission for
that file, eg. doing a <CODE>chmod a-w</CODE>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC26">5.5.1  Previewing the image contents</A></H3>

<P>
It is possible to look into the disk or tape image and see its directory
before attaching it: to do so, just press the "Contents" button in the
file selector window.  This way, a new window will be popped up with the
contents of the selected image.

</P>
<P>
Notice that this function automatically translates the directory from
PETSCII to ASCII; but, due to differences in the two encodings, it is
not always possible to translate all the characters, so you might get
funny results when "weird" characters such as the semi-graphical ones
are being used.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC27">5.5.2  "Autostarting" an image</A></H3>

<P>
If you want to reset the machine and run the first program on a certain
image without typing the command at the Commodore BASIC prompt, you can
use the "Autostart" button in the file selector window after selecting
a proper disk or tape image file.

</P>
<P>
Notice that, if true 1541 emulation is turned on, it will be turned off
before running the program and then turned on again after it has been
loaded.  This way, you get the maximum possible speed while loading the
file, but you don't loose compatibility when the actual program is
running.

</P>
<P>
This method is not completely safe, because some autostarting methods
might cause the true 1541 emulation not to be turned on again.  In such
cases, the best thing to do is to disable kernal traps (which will cause
true 1541 emulation to be always kept turned on), or to manually load
the program with true 1541 emulation turned on.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC28">5.5.3  Using compressed files</A></H3>

<P>
It is also possible to attach disk or tape images that have been
compressed through various algorithms; the compression format is
recognized from the file extension.  The following formats are supported
(the expected file name extension is in parenthesis):

</P>

<P> <UL>
<P> <LI>

GNU Zip (<CODE>.gz</CODE> or <CODE>.z</CODE>);
<P> <LI>

BZip version 2 (<CODE>.bz2</CODE>);
<P> <LI>

PkZip (<CODE>.zip</CODE>);
<P> <LI>

GNU Zipped TAR archives (<CODE>.tar.gz</CODE>, <CODE>.tgz</CODE>);
<P> <LI>

Zoo (<CODE>.zoo</CODE>).
</UL> </P>

<P>
PkZip, <CODE>tar.gz</CODE>, <CODE>lha</CODE> and <CODE>zoo</CODE> support is
<EM>read-only</EM> and always uses the <EM>first</EM> <CODE>T64</CODE> or
<CODE>D64</CODE> file in the archive.  So archives containing multiple files
will always be handled as if they contained one single file.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC29">5.6  Resetting the machine</A></H2>

<P>
You can reset the emulated machine at any time by using the "Reset"
command from the command menu.  There are two types of reset:

</P>

<P> <UL>
<P> <LI>

<EM>soft reset</EM>, which simply resets the CPU and all the chips;
<P> <LI>

<EM>hard reset</EM>, which also clears up the contents of RAM.
</UL> </P>

<P>
A <EM>soft reset</EM> is the same as a hardware reset achieved by pulling
the RESET line down; a <EM>hard reset</EM> is more like a power on/power
off sequence, which makes sure the whole RAM is cleared.

</P>
<P>
It is possible that a soft reset is not enough to bring the machine back
to the OS initialization sequence: in such cases, you have to do a hard
reset instead.

</P>
