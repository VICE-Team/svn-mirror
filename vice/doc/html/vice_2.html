<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC5">2  About VICE</A></H1>

<P>
VICE is the one and only <EM>Versatile Commodore Emulator</EM>.  It allows
you to emulate the Commodore 64, 128, VIC20 and PET 2001, 3032, 4032,
8032, 8096, 8296 8-bit computers with one single package.  The emulators
run as separate programs, but have the same user interface, share the
same settings and support the same file formats.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Important notice:</STRONG> If you have no idea about what a Commodore
8-bit computer is, or have questions about how these machines are used,
how the file formats work or everything else that is not strictly
related to VICE, you should read the appropriate FAQs <EM>first</EM>, as
this kind of information is not available here.  See section <A HREF="vice_12.html#SEC68">12  Contact information</A> for
information about how to retrieve the the FAQs.

</P>
<P>
All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with emulation
of all the opcodes and accurate timing.  Moreover, all of the
undocumented opcodes are implemented.  Unlike other emulators, the
emulation of all the chips is cycle accurate, and tries to emulate
timings as precisely as possible.

</P>
<P>
Please do <EM>not</EM> expect the VIC20, C128 and PET emulators to be as
good as the C64 one, as they are still under construction.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC6">2.1  C64 emulator features</A></H2>

<P>
The C64 emulator, called <SAMP>`x64'</SAMP>, features a fairly complete
emulation of the VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and all video
modes are fully emulated.  Since version 0.13.0, the emulation is fully
cycle-accurate.

</P>
<P>
Moreover, a rather complete emulation of the SID sound chip is provided.
All the basic features are implemented as well as most of the complex
ones including sync and ring modulation.  Filters are the only major
feature missing at the moment.

</P>
<P>
Of course, also both CIAs are cycle-accurate and fully emulated.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC7">2.2  C128 emulator features</A></H2>

<P>
The C128 emulator, called <SAMP>`x128'</SAMP>, features a complete emulation of
the internal MMU (<EM>Memory Management Unit</EM>), plus all the features
of the C64 emulation.  The following things are missing, though:

</P>

<P> <UL>
<P> <LI>

80-column VDC chip;
<P> <LI>

2 MHz mode;
<P> <LI>

C64 mode.
</UL> </P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC8">2.3  VIC20 emulator features</A></H2>

<P>
The VIC20 emulates all the internal hardware, including the VIA chips.
Only part of the VIC-I video chip features are emulated, so some
graphical effects will not work correctly.

</P>
<P>
Sound is implemented, but is still at the experimental stage.  If
you think it does not sound right and know how to improve it, feel
free to contact us (see section <A HREF="vice_12.html#SEC68">12  Contact information</A>).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC9">2.4  PET emulator features</A></H2>

<P>
The PET emulator emulates the 2001, 3032, 4032, 8032, 8096 and 8296
models, which almost covers all models of this kind of machines.  The
hardware is pretty much the same and that is why one single program is
enough to emulate all of them.  For more detailed information about PET
hardware please refer to the <TT>`PETdoc'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
Both the 40 column and 80 column CRTC video chips are emulated (from the
4032 onward), but a few of the features are not implemented yet (numbers
of rasterlines per char and lines per screen).  Anyway, those missing
features are not very important for average applications.

</P>
<P>
Sound is available for the PET as well, but like the VIC20 it is still
under construction.

</P>
<P>
The PET 8096 is basically a PET 8032 with a 64k extension board, that
allows remapping the upper 32k with RAM.  You have to write to a special
register at <CODE>$fff0</CODE> to remap the memory.  The PET 8296 is a
8096 but with a completely redesigned motherboard with 128k RAM in
total.  Of the additional 32k RAM you can use only some in blocks of 4k,
but you have to set jumpers on the motherboard for it.  VICE uses the
command line options <SAMP>`petram9'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-petramA'</SAMP>
instead.  Also the video controller can handle a larger address range.
The PET 8x96 model emulations run the Commodore LOS-96 operating system
- basically an improved BASIC 4 version with up to 32k for BASIC
text and 32k for variables.  See <TT>`PETdoc'</TT> for more information.

</P>
<P>
The PET computers came with three major ROM revisions, so-called BASIC
1, 2 and 4, all of which are provided.  The PET 2001 uses the version 1,
the PET 3032 uses version 2, and the others use version 4.  The 2001 ROM
is horribly broken in the IEEE488 part (they shipped it before they
tested it with the floppy drive, so only tape worked - which is not
supported in this emulator) so the ROM is patched to fix the IEEE488
routines.

</P>
<P>
What the 2001 patch basically does is (amongst more low level fixes)
get the load address for a program file from the first two
bytes of the file.  This allows loading of PET2001-saved files (that
have $0400 as load address) and other PET files (that have $0401).
The PET2001 still saves from $0400, not from $0401 as other PETs do.

</P>

<P>
Moreover, the secondary addresses being used now are <CODE>0</CODE> and
<CODE>1</CODE> for load and save, and not arbitrary unused secondary
addresses.

</P>
<P>
To select which model to run, you specify the model on the
command line with the <CODE>-model MODEL</CODE> option, where
<CODE>MODEL</CODE> can be one of a list of PET model numbers, all
described in ...

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC10">2.5  The keyboard emulation</A></H2>

<P>
There are two ways of emulating the keyboard in VICE.

</P>
<P>
The default way (<EM>symbolic mapping</EM>) is to map every X11 key
combination to the corresponding key combination on the real machine:
for example, if you press <KBD>*</KBD>, which is bound to <KBD>Shift-8</KBD> on
the U.S. keyboard layout, in the C64 emulator, the emulated machine will
have just the <EM>unshifted</EM> <KBD>*</KBD> key pressed (as <KBD>*</KBD> is
unshifted on the C64 keyboard).  Likewise, pressing <KBD>'</KBD> on the same
U.S. keyboard without any shift key will cause the combination
<KBD>Shift-7</KBD> to be pressed in the emulated C64.  This way, it becomes
quite obvious what keys should be typed to obtain all the symbols.

</P>
<P>
There is one problem with symbolic mapping, though: not all of the ASCII
symbols are available in the Commodore PETSCII character set and vice
versa, so some of the keys have to be mapped in a special way...

</P>

<P>
The second way (<EM>positional mapping</EM>) is to map every key on the
"real" keyboard to the key which has the same position on the keyboard
of the emulated machine.  This way, no <KBD>Shift</KBD> key is forced by the
program (with the exception of the function keys <KBD>F2</KBD>, <KBD>F4</KBD>,
<KBD>F6</KBD> and <KBD>F8</KBD>, which require <KBD>Shift</KBD> on the Commodore
keyboards), and the keyboard is more comfortable to use in those
programs (such as some games) that require the keys to be in the correct
positions.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> unlike the real C64, VICE "presses" the <KBD>Shift</KBD>
key <EM>together</EM> with the key to shift when the <KBD>Shift</KBD> must be
forced.  In most cases this should work fine, but some keyboard routines
are quite picky and tend not to recognize the shift key because of this.
For instance, <KBD>F6</KBD> (which on the real C64 is obtained with
<KBD>Shift + F5</KBD>) could be recognized as <KBD>F5</KBD>.  In that case, use
the shift key manually (i.e. type <KBD>Shift + F5</KBD> in the example).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC11">2.6  The joystick emulation</A></H2>

<P>
Joysticks can be emulated both via the keyboard and via a real joystick
connected to the host machine (the latter only works on GNU/Linux
systems).

</P>
<P>
There are two keyboard layouts, called <EM>numpad</EM> and <EM>custom</EM>
layouts respectively.

</P>
<P>
The <EM>numpad</EM> layout uses the numeric keypad keys, i.e. the numbers
<KBD>1</KBD>...<KBD>9</KBD> which emulate all the directions including the
diagonal ones; <KBD>0</KBD> emulates the fire button.

</P>
<P>
The <EM>custom</EM> layout uses the keys <KBD>q</KBD>, <KBD>w</KBD>, <KBD>e</KBD>,
<KBD>a</KBD>, <KBD>s</KBD>, <KBD>d</KBD>, <KBD>z</KBD>, <KBD>x</KBD>, <KBD>c</KBD> for the directions
and <KBD></KBD> for the fire button instead.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC12">2.7  The disk drive emulation</A></H2>

<P>
All the emulators support emulation of up to 4 external disk drives as
devices 8, 9, 10 and 11.  Each of these devices can emulate virtual
Commodore 1541 drives in two ways:

</P>

<P> <UL>
<P> <LI>

using disk images, i.e. files that contain a dump
of all the blocks contained in a real floppy disk (if you want more
information about what a disk image is, consult the
<CODE>comp.emulators.cbm</CODE> FAQ);
<P> <LI>

accessing file system directories, thus allowing you to access files
without having to copy them to disk images; this also allows you to
read and write files in the <CODE>P00</CODE> format (again, consult the
<CODE>comp.emulators.cbm</CODE> FAQ for more info).
</UL> </P>

<P>
Moreover, there are two available types of 1541 emulation for the first
kind of emulation.  One of them the <EM>DOS level</EM> drive emulation.  It
does <EM>not</EM> really emulate the serial line, but patches the kernal
ROM (with the so-called <EM>serial traps</EM>) so that serial line
operations can be emulated via C language routines.  This emulation is
very fast, but only allows use of standard DOS functions (and not even
all of them).

</P>
<P>
The other alternative is a <EM>hardware level</EM> drive emulation.  The
Commodore 1541 disk drive was provided with its own CPU (a 6502 as the
VIC20) and its own RAM and ROM.  So, in order to more closely emulate
its features, a complete emulation of this hardware must be provided and
that is what the <EM>hardware level</EM> emulation does.  When the
<EM>hardware level</EM> emulation is used, the kernal routines are no
longer patched and the serial line is fully emulated.  The problem with
this emulation is that it needs a lot of processing power, mainly
because the emulator has to emulate two CPUs instead of one.

</P>
<P>
The <EM>hardware level</EM> emulation is only available on the VIC20 and
C64 emulators, and can only be used to emulate one drive at a time.  As
a consequence, it is only available for unit 8 and disables all the
other drives when activated.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the PETs don't use a serial IEC bus to communicate
with the floppy, instead they use the parallel IEEE488 bus.  This bus
transfers <EM>byte by byte</EM>, as opposed to <EM>bit by bit</EM> as the
C64 and VIC20 do, so in this case it is feasible to emulate the parallel
line completely while emulating the drive at DOS level only.  The
IEEE488 line interpreter maps the drives 8-11 (as described above) to
the IEEE488 disk units, and no kernal traps are needed.  The same
emulation is available in the C64, to emulate the Commodore IEEE488 bus
interface.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC13">2.8  Supported file formats</A></H2>

<P>
VICE supports the most popular Commodore file formats:

</P>

<P> <UL>

<P> <LI>

<CODE>X64</CODE> (preferred) or <CODE>D64</CODE> disk image files;

<P> <LI>

<CODE>T64</CODE> tape image files (read-only);

<P> <LI>

<CODE>P00</CODE> program files.

</UL> </P>

<P>
An utility (<CODE>c1541</CODE>, see section <A HREF="vice_9.html#SEC63">9  C1541</A>) is provided to allow transfers
between these formats.

</P>
<P>
Notice that the native format for disk images is <CODE>X64</CODE>; this
means that, although the emulators and utilities can both read and write
on <CODE>D64</CODE> disk images, they never produce <CODE>D64</CODE> files.

</P>
<P>
You can convert an <CODE>X64</CODE> file back into a <CODE>D64</CODE> file with the
UNIX <CODE>dd</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
dd bs=64 skip=1 if=IMAGE.X64 of=IMAGE.D64
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC14">2.9  Common problems</A></H2>

<P>
VICE should compile and run without major problems on many UNIX systems,
but there are some known issues related to the sound driver.  In fact,
sound is the least portable part of the emulator and has not been
thoroughly tested on all the supported platforms yet.

</P>
<P>
Linux, AIX and SGI systems should play sound without any problems; if
you are running Linux please use the new 2.x kernels, as VICE needs some
features that were not implemented in older versions of the Linux sound
driver.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, HP-UX and Solaris machines are known to cause
troubles.  If you think you can help debugging the code for these
systems, your help would be really appreciated.  We are having troubles
finding HP-UX and SUN consoles to work at...
