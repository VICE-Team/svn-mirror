Prerequisites:
--------------

- update README and NEWS

to get a list of all changes since last release you can use svn log like this:

$ svn log -r <rev of last release>:<current rev> > log.txt

you can look up the revision of the last release in the tags directory in the
repo: https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/code/HEAD/tree/tags/

- update the html pages in doc/html (index.html, windows.html, macosx.html). use
  the checklinks.sh script to check the links.

$ ./checklinks.sh

- update vice.texi. use checkdoc.mak to find missing resources and options in
  the documentation.

$ make -f checkdoc.mak full

- make sure (c) dates are correct (README, index.html, vice.texi,
  src/sounddrv/soundflac.c, src/arch/gtk3/uiabout.c)

- make sure the list of team members is correct (vice.texi, infocontrib.sed)
  vice.texi contains the author list twice, once under "@c
  ---vice-core-team---", and once under "@node Copyright"

- after changing any of the above, make sure to run "make" so the changes will
  propagate to various files, and then commit the changed files.

- ANNOUNCE A CODE FREEZE ;)

- make sure the version in configure.ac is updated:

    m4_define(vice_version_major, 3)
    m4_define(vice_version_minor, 6)
    m4_define(vice_version_build, 0)
    m4_define(vice_version_label, )

- make sure the version is updated in other files (html/index.html).

These actually update the user-visible version in the binary/docs, so it should
happen only immediately before the release.

while at it, also check the following:

- are the "banners" on various sourceforge pages (tickets) still up to date?
- are the "readmes" in the files areas still up to date?

****************************************
 Tarball and Windows Builds - Automated
****************************************

  The file in .github/workflows/make-release.yml implements a release process that
  will create the dist tarball and then windows builds from that tarball. To trigger it,
  push a git tag like v3.6.0 to our github mirror. This will create a release on Github
  which can be seen at https://github.com/VICE-Team/svn-mirror/releases. The build
  process can be observed at https://github.com/VICE-Team/svn-mirror/actions.

  Please note that the 'clean' git branch is a direct sync from our svn repo. The 'main'
  branch adds in the Readme.md file that is displayed on Github but not present in the
  svn repo.

  Before triggering the build, you might want to make sure that the most recent SVN commit
  has a nice commit message about the release, as this will appear in certain places in
  Github. Make sure that the commit has synchronised over to Github before you trigger the
  build process.

  $ RELEASE=3.6.0

  $ git clone --branch clean --depth 1 git@github.com:VICE-Team/svn-mirror.git
     or if that doesnt work because github doesnt have your ssh key:
  $ git clone --branch clean --depth 1 https://github.com/VICE-Team/svn-mirror.git

  $ cd svn-mirror
  $ git tag $RELEASE
  $ git push origin $RELEASE

  Pushing the tag triggers the release build, and creates a 'release' on Github called 3.6.0.
  Annoyingly, this release will automatically include a zip and tgz of the source for that
  commit, without any way to prevent it.

 Tarball and Windows Builds - Manual
*************************************

  generate tarball:
  -----------------

  (make sure dos2unix is installed)

  first update and clean your sourcetree

  $ svn up
  $ make distclean

  now configure the source tree with sid engines included. this is
  needed because make dist propagates through the source tree, and if resid is
  not configured it will not have any makefiles to get 'make dist'ed

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure --with-resid
  $ make dist

  now unpack into a separate directory and test if compiling works. fix makefiles
  in case files are missing and build the tarball again.

  create a tagged branch on the svn

  $ svn cp <url of svn trunk> <url of svn tag>

  eg

  $ svn cp --username=gpz svn+ssh://gpz@svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/trunk/ svn+ssh://gpz@svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/tags/v3.4/


  generate windows binaries:
  --------------------------

  in msys2 configure the source as described above, then do

  $ make bindistzip

*************************************


publish the release
-------------------

- upload changes to the website on sf (don't forget the html documentation)

- upload the tarball to sf

- in the file list (downloads) on sf, click on the (I) symbol on the right of
  the new file(s) and then set it to the respective platform to change the
  default downloads

- announce the release on the ml (and eventually elsewhere)

- update the TODO wiki page (remove old crossed out things)

- PROFIT!!!
