Prerequisites:
--------------

- update README and NEWS

to get a list of all changes since last release you can use svn log like this:

$ svn log -r <rev of last release>:<current rev> > log.txt

you can look up the revision of the last release in the tags directory in the
repo: https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/code/HEAD/tree/tags/

- update the html pages in doc/html (index.html, windows.html, macosx.html). use
  the checklinks.sh script to check the links.

$ ./checklinks.sh

- update vice.texi. use checkdoc.mak to find missing resources and options in
  the documentation.

$ make -f checkdoc.mak full

- make sure (c) dates are correct (README, index.html, vice.texi,
  src/sounddrv/soundflac.c, src/arch/gtk3/uiabout.c)

- make sure the list of team members is correct (vice.texi, infocontrib.sed)
  vice.texi contains the author list twice, once under "@c
  ---vice-core-team---", and once under "@node Copyright"

- after changing any of the above, make sure to run "make" so the changes will
  propagate to various files, and then commit the changed files.

- ANNOUNCE A CODE FREEZE ;)

- make sure the version in configure.ac is updated:

    m4_define([vice_version_major], [3])
    m4_define([vice_version_minor], [4])
    m4_define([vice_version_build], [0])

- make sure the version is updated in other files (html/index.html).

These actually update the user-visible version in the binary/docs, so it should
happen only immediately before the release.

while at it, also check the following:

- are the "banners" on various sourceforge pages (tickets) still up to date?
- are the "readmes" in the files areas still up to date?


generate tarball:
-----------------

(make sure dos2unix is installed)

first update and clean your sourcetree

$ svn up
$ make distclean

now configure the source tree with sid engines included. this is
needed because make dist propagates through the source tree, and if resid is
not configured it will not have any makefiles to get 'make dist'ed

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-resid
$ make dist

now unpack into a separate directory and test if compiling works. fix makefiles
in case files are missing and build the tarball again.

create a tagged branch on the svn

$ svn cp <url of svn trunk> <url of svn tag>

eg

$ svn cp --username=gpz svn+ssh://gpz@svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/trunk/ svn+ssh://gpz@svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/tags/v3.4/


generate windows binaries:
--------------------------

in msys2 configure the source as described above, then do

$ make bindist7zip


publish the release
-------------------

- upload changes to the website on sf (don't forget the html documentation)

- upload the tarball to sf

- announce the release on the ml (and eventually elsewhere)

- update the TODO wiki page (remove old crossed out things)

- PROFIT!!!
