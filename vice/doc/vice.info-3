Using cartridge images
----------------------

   "Cartridge images" are like disk images, but mirror the contents of
cartridge ROM images instead of disk images.  They are currently not
supported on the C128 emulator.

   X64 allows you to attach the following kinds of cartridges:

   * `.crt' images, as used by the CCS64 emulator by Per H^akan Sundell;

   * generic raw dumps of 8K and 16K images;

   * Action Replay images.

   Each of these kinds has a specific command in the "Attach a cartridge
image" submenu.  When you have successfully attached a cartridge image,
you should then reset the machine to make sure the cartridge initializes
itself.  Of course, it is also possible to detach a currently attached
cartridge image ("Detach cartridge image").

   If you are using an Action Replay cartridge, you can emulate the
cartridge's freeze button with the "Freeze" command.

VIC-II settings
---------------

   These settings control the emulation of the VIC-II (MOS6569) video
chip used in both the C64 and the C128.

   * "Sprite-sprite collisions" and "Sprite-background collisions", if
     enabled, cause the hardware detection of sprite-to-sprite and
     sprite-to-background collisions of the VIC-II to be emulated.  This
     feature is used by many games, and disabling either of the two
     detection systems can sometimes make you invincible (although
     there is also a chance that also enemies become invincible then).

   * "Color set" can be used to dynamically change the palette file
     being used by choosing one of the available predefined color sets:

        * `default.vpl' ("default"), the default VICE palette;

        * `ccs64.vpl' ("CCS64"), palette taken from the CCS64 emulator
          by Per H^akan Sundell (http://www.fatal-design.com/ccs64/).

        * `frodo.vpl' ("Frodo"), palette taken from the Frodo emulator
          by Christian Bauer
          (http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/FRMain.html).

        * `godot.vpl' ("GoDot"), palette as suggested by the authors of
          the C64 graphics package GoDot
          (http://users.aol.com/howtogodot/welcome.htm).

audio chip.

   * "Emulate filters" causes the built-in programmable filters of the
     SID chip to be emulated.  A lot of C64 music requires them to be
     emulated properly, but their emulation requires some additional
     processor power.

     there are two slightly different generations of SID chips: MOS6581
     ones and MOS8580 ones.

C64 I/O extension settings
--------------------------

   There are three I/O extensions available: they are located at the
address range $DF00 ... $DFFF and each of them is controlled by a
boolean resource.  Please use these extensions only when needed, as they
might cause compatibility problems.

   * The "emulator identification" extension allows programs to
     identify the kind of emulator they are running on, according to the
     emulation detection proposal by Wolfgang Lorenz.  This basically
     means that, when some locations in the $DFxx I/O space are read,
     the emulator returns some values which identify the emulator
     itself, its version and a copyright message.  If this extension is
     disabled, programs will have virtually no way to realize they are
     running on an emulator.

   * The "IEEE488 interface emulation" extension emulates a standard
     Commodore IEEE488 interface connected to the IEC bus; one possible
     use for this is Andr'e Fachat's OS/A65 multitasking operating
     system.

   * The "512K RAM Expansion Unit" extension emulates a standard 512K
     Commodore RAM Expansion Unit; this can be used with GEOS and other
     programs that are designed to take advantage of it.  This currently
     works only in the C64 emulator.

RS232 settings
--------------

   X64 and X128 can support RS232 in the following ways:

   * by emulating Daniel Dallmann's 9600 baud userport-based RS232
     interface;

   * by emulating a 6551-based RS232 interface located at $DE00.

   Each of these emulated devices can be either:

   * connected a real UNIX serial device;

   * dumped to a file;

   * piped through a process.

   It is possible to define up to two UNIX serial devices, and then
decide which interface should be connected to which device.  Devices are
defined through the following settings:

   * "Serial 1 device..." and "Serial 2 device..." are used to specify
     the the pathnames of the serial devices, with the file selector;

   * "Serial 1 baudrate" and "Serial 2 baudrate" specify the baudrate.

VIC20-specific commands and settings
====================================

   This section lists the settings and commands that are VIC20-specific
and thus are not present in the other emulators.

File: vice.info,  Node: VIC20 cartridges,  Next: VIC20 memory expansions,  Prev: VIC20-specific,  Up: VIC20-specific

Using cartridge images
----------------------

   As with the C64 (*note C64 cartridges::.), it is possible to attach
several types of cartridge images:

   * 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $2000;

   * 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $6000;

   * 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $A000;

   * 4 Kbyte cartridges located at $B000.

   This can all be done via the "Attach cartridge image..." command in
the left-button menu.  It is also possible to let XVIC "guess" the type
of cartridge using "Smart-attach cartridge image...".

   Notice that several cartridges are actually made up of two pieces
(and two files), that need to be loaded separately at different
addresses.  In that case, you have to know the addresses (which are
usually specified in the file name) and use the "attach" command twice.


File: vice.info,  Node: VIC20 memory expansions,  Next: VIC20 system ROM settings,  Prev: VIC20 cartridges,  Up: VIC20-specific

Changing memory configuration
-----------------------------

   It is possible to change the VIC20 memory configuration in two ways:
by enabling and/or disabling certain individual memory blocks, or by
choosing one among a few typical memory configurations.  The former can
be done by modifying resource values directly or from the right-button
menu; the latter can only be done from the menu.

   There are 5 RAM expansion blocks in the VIC20, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3
and 5:

   * block 0 (3 Kbytes at $0400-$0FFF);

   * block 1 (8 Kbytes at $2000-$3FFF);

   * block 2 (8 Kbytes at $4000-$5FFF);

   * block 3 (8 Kbytes at $6000-$7FFF);

   * block 5 (8 Kbytes at $A000-$BFFF).

   These blocks are called "expansion blocks" because they are not
present a stock ("unexpanded") machine.  Each of them is associated to
a boolean `RamBlockX' resource (where `X' is the block number) that
specifies whether the block is enabled or not.

   There are also some common memory configurations you can pick from
the right-button menu:

   * no RAM expansion blocks at all;

   * all RAM expansion blocks enabled;

   * 3K expansion (only block 0 is enabled);

   * 8K expansion (only block 1 is enabled);

   * 16K expansion (only blocks 1 and 2 are enabled);

   * 24K expansion (only blocks 1, 2 and 3 are enabled).

   As with the X64 (*note C64 I/O extension settings::.), it is also
possible to enable a special emulator identification mechanism that uses
certain memory locations to let a running program query information
about the emulator itself; this is enabled by the "Emulator
identification" option.

     Boolean specifying whether the emulation identification extension
     must be enabled.


File: vice.info,  Node: VIC20 memconf options,  Prev: VIC20 memconf resources,  Up: VIC20 memory expansions

VIC20 memory configuration command-line options
...............................................

`-memory CONFIG'
     Specify memory configuration.  It must be a comma-separated list of
     options, each of which can be one the following:

        * `none' (no extension);

        * `all' (all blocks);

        * `3k' (3k space in block 0);

        * `8k' (first 8k extension block);

        * `16k' (first and second 8k extension blocks);

        * `24k' (first, second and 3rd extension blocks);

        * `0', `1', `2', `3', `5' (memory in respective blocks);

        * `04', `20', `40', `60', `A0' (memory at respective address.

     For example,

          xvic -memory none

     gives an unexpanded VIC20.  While

          xvic -memory 60,a0

     or

          xvic -memory 3,5

     enables memory in blocks 3 and 5, which is the usual configuration
     for 16k ROM modules.

Changing PET model settings
---------------------------

   With `xpet', it is possible to change at runtime the characteristics
of the emulated PET so that it matches (or not) the ones of a certain
PET model, and it is also possible to select from a common set of PET
models so that all the features are selected accordingly.

   The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

`RamSize'
     Size of memory in kByte. 96k denotes a 8096, 128k a 8296.

`IOSize'
     Size of I/O area in Byte. Either 2048 or 256 for 8296.

`Crtc'
     Enables CRTC 6545 emulation (all models from 40xx and above)

`VideoSize'
     The number of columns on the screen (40 or 80). A 0 auto-detects
     this from the ROM.

`Ram9'
     The 8296 can map RAM into the address range $9***

`RamA'
     The 8296 can map RAM into the address range $A***

`SuperPET'
     This resource enables the SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) I/O and
     disables the 8x96 mappings.

`ChargenName'
     Specify `NAME' as the character generator ROM file

`KernalName'
     Specify `NAME' as the kernal ROM file. This file contains the
     complete BASIC, EDITOR and KERNAL ROMs and is either 16k (BASIC 1
     and 2) or 20k (BASIC 4) in size.

`EditorName'
     Specify `NAME' as the editor ROM file. This file contains an
     overlay for the editor ROM at $E000-$E7FF if necessary.

`RomModule9Name'
     Specify `NAME' as the $9*** Expansion ROM file. This file contains
     an expansion ROM image of 4k.

`RomModuleAName'
     Specify `NAME' as the $A*** Expansion ROM file. This file contains
     an expansion ROM image of 4k.

`RomModuleBName'
     Specify `NAME' as the $B*** Expansion ROM file. This file contains
     an expansion ROM image of 4k.  This file overlays the lowest 4k of
     a BASIC 4 ROM.

   Choosing a common PET model is done from the right-button menu
instead, by choosing an item from the "Model defaults" submenu.
Available models are:

   * PET 2001-8N

   * PET 3008

   * PET 3016

   * PET 3032

   * PET 3032B

   * PET 4016

   * PET 4032

   * PET 4032B

   * PET 8032

   * PET 8096

   * PET 8296

   * SuperPET

   Notice that this will *reset the emulated machine*.

   It is also possible to select the PET model at startup, with the
`-model' command-line option: for example, `xpet -model 3032' will
emulate a PET 3032 while `xpet -model 8296' will emulate a PET 8296.

(*note Palette files::.) in the `PaletteName' resource.  The menu
provides the following values:

   * `default.vpl' ("default (green)"), the good old green-on-black
     feeling;

   * `amber.vpl' ("amber"), an amber phosphor lookalike;

   This section lists the settings and commands that are
CBM-II-specific and thus are not present in the other emulators.

Changing CBM-II model
---------------------

   With `x610', it is possible to change at runtime the characteristics
of the emulated CBM so that it matches (or not) the ones of a certain
CBM model, and it is also possible to select from a common set of CBM
models so that all the features are selected accordingly.

   The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

`RamSize'
     Size of memory in kByte. Possible values are 128, 256, 512 and 1024

`Ram1, Ram2, Ram4, Ram6'
     Expanded CBM-II models could map RAM to the expansion ROM areas at
     $1***, $2000-$3FFF, $4000-$5FFF, $6000-$7FFF respectively.

`Cart2Name, Cart4Name, Cart6Name'
     Specify `NAME' as the $2000-$3FFF, $4000-$5FFF or $6000-$6FFF
     Expansion ROM file. This file contains an 8k ROM dump.

   Choosing a common CBM-II model is done from the right-button menu
instead, by choosing an item from the "Model defaults" submenu.
Available models are:

   * C610 (128k RAM)

   * C620 (256k RAM)

   * C620+ (1024k RAM, expanded)

   Notice that this will *reset the emulated machine*.

   It is also possible to select the CBM model at startup, with the
`-model' command-line option: for example, `x610 -model C610' will
emulate a CBM 610 while `x610 -model C620' will emulate a CBM 620.

Changing screen colors
----------------------

   It is also possible to choose what color set is used for the
emulation window.  This is done by specifying a palette file name
(*note Palette files::.) in the `PaletteName' resource.  The menu
provides the following values:

   * `default.vpl' ("default (green)"), the good old green-on-black
     feeling;

   * `amber.vpl' ("amber"), an amber phosphor lookalike;

   * `white.vpl' ("white"), simple white-on-black palette.

Snapshots
*********

   Every VICE emulator has a built-in snapshot feature, that saves the
complete Emulator state (see below) into one file. This file can then
be used to restore the emulator state by loading it.

* Menu:

* Snapshot usage::
* Snapshot format::


File: vice.info,  Node: Snapshot usage,  Next: Snapshot format,  Prev: Snapshots,  Up: Snapshots

Snapshot usage
==============

   A snapshot is one file.  It contains the complete emulator state.  A
snapshot file can be generated by selecting the `save snapshot' menu
entry at any time.

   A snapshot file can be used to restore the emulator state by
selecting the `load snapshot' menu entry at any time.

   Warning: The complete state is saved, but the following things are
*not* restored:

   * The ROMs. This can pose problems when restoring the state of a PET
     3032 into a PET 4032 for example. Also attached cartridges are not
     saved.  I.e. you have to attach them before restoring a snapshot
     of run of such a cartridge.

   * The memory configuration.  The VIC20, PET and CBM-II emulators do
     have some memory expansion info.  This is saved but not (yet??)
     restored.


File: vice.info,  Node: Snapshot format,  Prev: Snapshot usage,  Up: Snapshots

Snapshot format
===============

   A snapshot file consists of several modules.  Each module has a name.
A module saves the state of an entity like a CIA, the CPU, or the
memory.

   Some of the modules are optional and are only saved if the specific
feature is enabled at save-time. If the module is found when restoring
the state the optional features are enabled, and disabled otherwise.

Module formats
--------------

   This section shows the basic module framework and the contents of
the different types of modules.

   The single chip modules contain the chip state, not the state of the
emulator. We tried to make the format as implementation-independent as
possible, to allow reuse of snapshots in later versions of this
emulator, or even in other emulators.

Terminology
...........

   In this section we use certain abbreviations to define the types of
the data saved in the snapshot.

`BYTE'
     8 bit integer.

`WORD'
     16 bit integer. Saved with low-byte first, high-byte last.

`DWORD'
     32 bit integer. Saved with low-word first, then high-word. Each
     word saved with its low-byte first.

`ARRAY'
     Array of BYTE values. Length depends on the description.

   The tables for the single modules state the type, name and
description of the data saved in the modules. The data is saved in the
order it is in the tables, so no offset is given.

   The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip. VICE emulates RS232
connections via `/dev/ttyS*' (Unix) or `COM:' (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.  The
state of the ACIA however is restored if possible. I.e. if a connection
is already open when restoring the snapshot, this connection is used
instead. If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR drop is emulated.

Monitor
*******

   Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be
used to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as
well as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using
the "Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that you have
to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as `rxvt'
or `xterm') in order to use the monitor.

   Warning: this version of the monitor is still under construction,
and some of the features are not fully working yet.

Terminology
===========

`address_space'
     This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of
     registers.  This can be the addresses available to the computer's
     processor, the disk drive's processor or a specific memory
     configuration of one of the mentioned processors.

`register'
     One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
     accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

`address'
     A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

`address_range'
     Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
     range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both
     addresses must be in the same address space.

`address_opt_range'
     An address or an address range.

`prompt'
     The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
     monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second
     part of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

`checkpoint'
     The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an
     action when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types
     of checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

`breakpoint'
     A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
     triggered, the monitor is entered.

`tracepoint'
     Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
     counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
     printed and execution continues.

`watchpoint'
     Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.
     When a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

`<...>'
     A data type.

`*'
     Zero or more occurrences.

`[...]'
     An optional argument.

Machine state commands
======================

`goto <address>'
     Change the PC to address and continue execution.

`io'
     Nothing yet.  Will display VIC/VIA/CIA/SID registers.

`next [<count>]'
     Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as a
     single instruction.

`registers [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
     Assign respective registers.  With no parameters, display register
     values.

`return'
     Continues execution  and returns to the monitor just
     before(after?) the next RTS or RTI is executed.

`step [<count>]'
     Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows
     stepping more than a single instruction at a time.
