    <p> <b>VICE</b> is the one and only <dfn><b>V</b>ersat<b>i</b>le
	<b>C</b>ommodore <b>E</b>mulator</dfn>.  It allows you to emulate
      the Commodore C64, VIC20 and PET2001/3032/4032/8032/8096/8296 8-bit
      computers with one single package.  The emulators run as separate
      programs, but have the same user interface, share the same
      settings and support the same file formats. </p>

    <ul>

	<p> <u><strong> Important notice </strong></u> <br>

	  If you have no idea about what a Commodore 8-bit computer is,
	  or have questions about how these machines are used, how the
	  file formats work or everything else that is not strictly
	  related to VICE, you should read the appropriate FAQs
	  <em>first</em>, as this kind of information is not available
	  here.  See the ``<a href="#contacts">contacts</a>'' section
	  for more information. </p>

    </ul>

    <p> If you are a user of the previous 0.11.0 version, you will
      notice that the C128 emulator is no longer included.  We apologize
      for this, but there was really no time to work at it anymore, as
      too much time was been spent with the many improvements for the
      other emulators.  If you need the C128 emulator you must stick to
      the 0.11.0 release (which is still available)... or help us to
      maintain it in the new VICE versions. </p>

    <h3> <a name="overview-features"> 1.1. Emulation features </a> </h3>

    <p> All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with
      emulation of all the opcodes and accurate timing.  Also, all of the
      undocumented opcodes are implemented. Unlike other emulators, the
      emulation of all the chips (except the VIAs) is cycle accurate,
      and tries to emulate timings as precisely as possible. </p>

    <p> Please do <em>not</em> expect the VIC20 and PET emulators to be as
      good as the C64 one, as they are still under construction. </p>

    <h4><a name="overview-features-c64"> 1.1.1. C64 emulator </a> </h4>

    <p> The C64 emulator features a fairly complete emulation of the
      VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and all video modes are
      fully emulated.  Since version 0.13.0, the emulation is fully
      cycle-accurate. </p>

    <p> Moreover, a rather complete emulation of the SID sound chip is
    provided.  All the basic features are implemented as well as most
    of the complex ones including sync and ring modulation.  Filters
    are the only major feature missing at the moment. </p>

    <p> Of course, also both CIAs are cycle-accurate and fully
    emulated. </p>

    <h4> <a name="overview-features-vic20"> 1.1.2. VIC20 emulator </a> </h4>

    <p> The VIC20 is not complete yet, but already emulates all the
      internal hardware, including the VIA chips.  Only part of the VIC-I
      video chip features are emulated, so many graphical effects will not
      work correctly. </p>

    <p> Sound is implemented, but is still at the experimental stage.  If
      you think it does not sound right and know how to improve it, feel
      free to contact us. </p>

    <p> The VIA chips are <em>not</em> cycle-exact at the moment. </p>

    <h4> <a name="overview-features-pet"> 1.1.3 PET emulator </a> </h4>

    <p> The PET emulator emulates the 2001, 3032, 4032, 8032, 8096 and
      8296 models, which in general covers all models of this kind of
      machines! The hardware is pretty much the same and that is
      why one single program is enough to emulate all of them.
      For more detailed information about PET hardware please refer
      to the <a href="PETdoc">PETdoc</a> file.</p>

    <p> Both the 40 column and 80 column CRTC video chips are
      emulated (from the 4032 onward), but a few of the features are
      not implemented yet (numbers of rasterlines per char and lines
      per screen).  Anyway, those missing features are not very
      important for average applications. </p>

    <p> Sound is available for the PET as well, but like the VIC20
      it is still under construction.  Of course, also the PET VIA
      is not cycle-exact. </p>

    <p> The PET 8096 is basically a PET 8032 with a 64k extension
      board, that allows remapping the upper 32k with RAM.  You have to
      write to a special register at <code>$fff0</code> to remap the
      memory.  The PET 8296 is a 8096 but with a completely redesigned
      motherboard with 128k RAM in total.  Of the additional 32k RAM you
      can use only some in blocks of 4k, but you have to set jumpers on
      the motherboard for it. VICE uses the command line options
      <code>-petram9</code> and <code>-petramA</code> instead.  Also the
      video controller can handle a larger address range.  The PET 8x96
      model emulations run the Commodore LOS-96 operating system -
      basically an improved BASIC&nbsp;4 version with up to 32k for
      BASIC text and 32k for variables.  See <a href="PETdoc">PETdoc</a>
      for more information. </p>

    <p> The PET computers came with three major ROM revisions, so-called
      BASIC 1, 2 and 4. all of which are provided. The PET 2001 uses
      the version 1, the PET 3032 uses version 2, and the others use
      version 4. The 2001 ROM is horribly broken in the IEEE488 part
      (they shipped it before they tested it with the floppy drive, so
      only tape worked - which is not supported in this emulator)
      so the ROM is patched to fix the IEEE488 routines.

    <p> What the 2001 patch basically does is (amongst more low level fixes)
      get the load address for a program file from the first two
      bytes of the file.  This allows loading of PET2001-saved files (that
      have $0400 as load address) and other PET files (that have $0401).
      The PET2001 still saves from $0400, not from $0401 as other PETs do.

    <ul>
        <p> <strong>Warning</strong>: The (German) machine language lessons
          from <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm"><tt>ftp.funet.fi</tt></a>
          are one byte too short (the files <tt>"machineles *"</tt>. in the
          <tt>"basicles.lha"</tt> archive there). This usually results
          in a machine lockup after load.  To use them you have to type the
          following before loading:</p>

        <ul>
            <tt>
            <p> NEW&lt;return&gt; </p>
            <p> FOR I=1200 TO 8192:POKE I,0:NEXT&lt;return&gt; </p>
            </tt>
        </ul>

        <p> This clears the memory, which kind of emulates the last
          missing nullbyte (you can also achieve the same result using
          the built-in monitor with `<code>fill 400 2000 0</code>').
          When saving, the PET2001 adds an additional byte to the file,
          so those files might grow! </p>
    </ul>

    <p> Moreover, the secondary addresses being used now are
      <tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt> for load and save, and not arbitrary
      unused secondary addresses. </p>

    <p> To select which model to run, you specify the model on the
      command line with the <tt>-model MODEL</tt> option, where
      <tt>MODEL</tt> can be one of a list of PET model numbers, all
      described <a href="#petmodel">below</a>.

    <h3> <a name="overview-keyboard"> 1.2. The keyboard </a> </h3>

    <p> Using the keyboard is quite straightforward, as each key is mapped
      to its usual character.  VICE will press and release the Shift
      keys automatically to make everything work as expected. </p>

    <p> Special keys are mapped differently for the VIC20 and C64
      emulators and the PET emulator. </p>

    <p> VIC20/C64 mapping: </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
	<pre>
X11 key                    VIC20/C64 key
---------------------      ---------------------

TAB                        RESTORE
LEFT CTRL                  CTRL
BACKSPACE                  DEL
INSERT                     INS
LEFT ALT                   C= (Commodore key)
ESC			   STOP
	</pre>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> PET mapping: </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
	<pre>
X11 key                    PET key
---------------------      ---------------------

LEFT ALT                   REVERSE
LEFT CTRL		   STOP
RIGHT CTRL	           RPT (8032 only)
BACKSPACE                  DEL
INSERT                     INS

	</pre>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> When joystick emulation via the numeric keypad is enabled, the
      numeric keypad emulates the joystick as follows: </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
	<pre>
            8 (up)

   (left) 4   6 (right)

            2 (down)

   (fire) 0 or right Control
	</pre>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> In order to emulate diagonal directions, you can either press
      two direction keys together or use the <tt>7</tt>, <tt>9</tt>,
      <tt>1</tt> and <tt>3</tt> keys. </p>

    <p> One catch for the PET, though. Because the PET do have a
      numerical keyboard and the joysticks are rarely used, the joystick
      emulation can be switched on and off via menu, resource and
      the command line option <code>-npjoystick</code>.

    <p> There are also some keys that perform frequently used
      commands: </p>

    <p>
    <ul>

      <li> <tt>F10</tt>  attach a disk image
      <li> <tt>F11</tt>  swap joysticks <em>(x64 only)</em>
      <li> <tt>F12</tt>  perform a power-up reset

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3> <a name="overview-diskdrive"> 1.3. The disk drive emulation </a> </h3>

    <p> All the emulators support emulation of up to 4 external disk
      drives as devices 8, 9, 10 and 11.  Devices 8, 9 and 10 emulate
      virtual Commodore 1541 drives using disk images, i.e. files that
      contain a dump of all the blocks contained in a real floppy disk
      (if you want more information about what a disk image is, consult
      the <tt>comp.emulators.cbm</tt> FAQ).  Device 11, instead,
      accesses file system directories, thus allowing you to access
      files without having to copy them to disk images.  In addition,
      device 11 can be used to read and write <tt>P00</tt> files (notice
      that, unlike other emulators, VICE uses the real file system name
      instead of the internal <tt>P00</tt> name to access these
      files). </p>

    <p> There are two available types of 1541 emulation for the disk
      image-based emulation.  One of them the <em>DOS level</em> drive
      emulation.  It does <em>not</em> really emulate the serial line,
      but patches the kernal ROM (with the so-called <em>serial
      traps</em>) so that serial line operations can be emulated via C
      language routines.  This emulation is very fast, but only allows
      use of standard DOS functions (and not even all of them). </p>

    <p> The other alternative is a <em>hardware level</em> drive
      emulation.  The Commodore 1541 disk drive was provided with its
      own CPU (a 6502 as the VIC20) and its own RAM and ROM.  So, in
      order to more closely emulate its features, a complete emulation
      of this hardware must be provided and that is what the
      <em>hardware level</em> emulation does.  When the <em>hardware
	level</em> emulation is used, the kernal routines are no longer
      patched and the serial line is fully emulated.  The problem with
      this emulation is that it needs a lot of processing power, mainly
      because the emulator has to emulate two CPUs instead of one. </p>

    <p> The <em>hardware level</em> emulation is only available on the
      VIC20 and C64 emulators, and can only be used to emulate one
      drive at a time.  As a consequence, it is only available for unit
      8 and disables all the other drives when activated. </p>

    <p> On the other hand, the PETs don't use a serial IEC bus to
      communicate with the floppy, instead they use the parallel IEEE488
      bus. This bus transfers <em>byte by byte</em>, as opposed to
      <em>bit by bit</em> as the C64 and VIC20 do, so in this case it is
      feasible to emulate the parallel line completely while emulating
      the drive at DOS level only.  The IEEE488 line interpreter maps
      the drives 8-11 (as described above) to the IEEE488 disk units,
      and no kernal traps are needed.  The same emulation is available
      in the C64, to emulate the Commodore IEEE488 bus interface. </p>

    <h3> <a name="overview-fileformats"> 1.4. Supported file formats </a> </h3>

    <p> VICE supports the most popular file formats: </p>

    <ul>

      <li> <tt>X64</tt> (preferred) or <tt>D64</tt> disk image files;

      <li> <tt>T64</tt> tape image files (read-only);

      <li> <tt>P00</tt> program files.

    </ul>

    <p> An utility (<tt>c1541</tt>) is provided to allow transfers
      between these formats. </p>

    <p> Notice that the native format for disk images is <tt>X64</tt>;
      this means that, although the emulators and utilities can both
      read and write on <tt>D64</tt> disk images, they never produce
      <tt>D64</tt> files. </p>

    <p> You can convert an <tt>X64</tt> file back into a <tt>D64</tt>
      file with the UNIX <tt>dd</tt> command: </p>

    <ul>

	<code> dd bs=64 skip=1 if=IMAGE.X64 of=IMAGE.D64 </code>

    </ul>

    <h3> <a name="overview-syspec"> 1.5. System-specific notes </a> </h3>

    <p> VICE should compile and run without major problems on many
      UNIX systems, but there are some known issues related to the sound
      driver.  In fact, sound is the least portable part of the emulator
      and has not been thoroughly tested on all the supported platforms
      yet. </p>

    <p> Linux, AIX and SGI systems should play sound without any
      problems; if you are running Linux please use the new 2.x
      kernels, as VICE needs some features that were not implemented
      in older versions of the Linux sound driver. </p>

    <p> On the other hand, HP-UX and Solaris machines are known to
      cause troubles.  If you think you can help debugging the code for
      these systems, your help would be really appreciated.  We are
      having troubles finding HP-UX and SUN consoles to work at... </p>

    <h2> <a name="usage"> 2. Usage </a> </h2> <p>

    <h3> <a name="usage-emulators"> 2.1. Using the PET/VIC20/C64
	emulators </a> </h3>

    <p> The names of the available emulators are: </p>

    <ul>

      <li> <tt>x64</tt>, the C64 emulator

      <li> <tt>xpet</tt>, the PET emulator

      <li> <tt>xvic</tt>, the VIC20 emulator

    </ul>

    <p> You can run each of them by simply typing the name from a
    shell. If you want to run them from another application (e.g. a
    window manager or some other sort of program launcher) you should
    always run them from a terminal window such as <tt>xterm</tt> or
    <tt>rxvt</tt>, as a lot of debugging information is printed and
    the built-in monitor will be run in there. </p>

    <p>There are several options you can specify on the command line, and the
      <tt>-help</tt> option lists them all.  See
      <a href="#usage-emulators-resources">below</a> for a detailed description
      of all the command-line options. </p>

    <h4> <a name="usage-emulators-roms"> 2.1.1. The system ROMs </a> </h4>

    <p> In order to work properly, the emulators need to load the system
      ROMs.  The place where they will be searched for depends on the
      value of the <tt>directory</tt> resource. (See
      <a href="#usage-emulators-resources">below</a> for a description of
      what resources are and how they can be changed) </p>

    <p> If <tt>directory</tt> is empty, the emulator will search for the
      ROMs in two places; first of all, it will try to load them from </p>

    <ul>
      <samp>
	/usr/local/lib/vice/&lt;EMU&gt;
      </samp>
    </ul>

    <p> where <tt>&lt;EMU&gt;</tt> is the emulator ID and can be either
      <tt>C64</tt>, <tt>VIC20</tt> or <tt>PET</tt>. If they are not
      found here, it will try to load them from the current directory,
      under <tt>C64</tt>, <tt>VIC20</tt> or <tt>PET</tt>. </p>

    <p> If a <tt>directory</tt> has been specified instead, the
      emulator will always try to boot <em>only</em> from that
      directory. </p>

    <p> The default ROM names for the VIC20 and C64 emulators are
      the following: </p>

    <ul>

	<li> <tt>kernal</tt>,  the Kernal ROM (8 KBytes)

	<li> <tt>basic</tt>, the Basic ROM (8 KBytes)

        <li> <tt>chargen</tt>, the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes
          on the VIC20 and the C64, 2 Kbytes on the PET)

    </ul>

    <p> For the PET emulator the Basic and Kernal ROMS are packed into a
      single file. Only three kernal files are provided; one for each basic
      revision. To handle the different screen sizes and keyboards,
      different so-called `editor-ROMs' for the memory range
      <tt>$E000-$E800</tt> are provided. The kernal files contain
      an editor ROM for 40 columns and graphics keyboard already.
      The PET ROMs have the following names: </p>

    <ul>

	<li> <tt> pet2001</tt>, the PET2001 Basic 1 + Kernal ROM (16
	KBytes)

	<li> <tt> pet3032</tt>, the PET3032 Basic 2 + Kernal ROM (16
	KBytes)

	<li> <tt> pet4032</tt>, the PET4032/8032 Basic 4 + Kernal ROM (20
	KBytes)

        <li> <tt> edit2.b</tt>, the PET3032 editor for business keyboard
        (2 KBytes)

        <li> <tt> edit4.b40</tt>, the PET4032 editor for business keyboard
        (2 KBytes)

        <li> <tt> edit4.b80</tt>, the PET8032 editor for 80 columns and
        business keyboard (2 KBytes)

    </ul>

    <p> The PETs also have sockets for extension ROMs for the addresses
      <tt>$9000-$9FFF</tt>, <tt>$A000-$AFFF</tt> and <tt>$B000-$BFFF</tt>
      (the last one for PET2001 and PET3032 only). You can specify ROM
      image files for those extensions command line options
      <tt>-petrom9</tt>, <tt>-petromA</tt> and <tt>-petromB</tt> resp.</p>

    <p> An alternative would be to specify a long kernal ROM with the
      <tt>-kernal</tt> option that includes the extension ROM areas
      already.</p>

    <p> Also, you can specify a replacement for the basic ROM at
      <tt>$B000-$DFFF</tt> with the <tt>-petromBasic</tt> option and
      a replacement for the editor ROM at <tt>$E000-$E7FF</tt> with the
      <tt>-petromEditor</tt> option.</p>

    <p> You can also edit the configuration file as explained in the
      <a href="#usage-emulators-resources">appropriate section</a>. </p>

    <p> When started, the emulator will also try to load a RAM image file
      (default name is <tt>ram</tt>) with the same behavior described
      above.  If not found, the RAM will be initialized as after a
      power-up. </p>

    <h4> <a name="usage-emulators-menus"> 2.1.2. The menus </a> </h4>

    <p> When the emulator is running, two pop-up menus can be opened by pressing
      the right and left mouse button.  The `left' menu is used to issue
      commands, while the `right' menu can be used to change emulation
      settings. </p>

    <ul>

      <li> <b>Command Menu:</b> (left button) <p>

	<ul>

	  <li> <b>Attach Disk Image</b>
	  <li> <b>Detach Disk Image</b>
	  <li> <b>Attach Tape Image...</b> <em> (x64 only) </em>
	  <li> <b>Detach Tape Image</b> <em> (x64 only) </em>

            <p> These commands can be used to insert or remove virtual
              disks and cassette tapes from the emulated units.
              Supported formats are <tt>D64</tt> and <tt>X64</tt> for
              disk images (devices 8, 9 and 10) and <tt>T64</tt> for
              tape images.<br> Notice that <tt>T64</tt> support is
              <em>read-only</em>, and that the cassette is automatically
              rewound from the start when you reach the end.<br> Disk
              images can also be attached to unit 8 by pressing the
              <tt>F10</tt> key. </p>

            <p> Another important feature is that raw Commodore BASIC
              binary files and <tt>.P00</tt> files can be attached as
              tapes.  As you can autostart a tape image when it is
              attached (as explained below), this allows you to
              autostart these particular files as well.  </p>

            <p> When one of these options is selected, a file selector
              dialog is popped up.  On the left, there is a list of
              ancestor directories of the current one: by clicking on
              them, you can go up the directory tree.  On the right,
              there is a list of the files in the current directory,
              which can be selected by clicking on them.  If you click
              on a directory, that directory becomes the current one; if
              you click on an ordinary file, it becomes active.  On the
              bottom there are three buttons: `OK' attaches the selected
              file as a disk/tape image, `Contents' shows its directory
              and `Cancel' abandons the file selector without any
              changes.  Another `Autostart' button (only available on
              <tt>x64</tt>) allows you to attach the disk or tape image
              and then automagically run the first program on it; this
              button is not available when attaching disk images to
              drives 9 and 10.  Also notice that this might not work
              with all the programs, and that, even if the true 1541
              emulation is turned on, the first program is always loaded
              in fast 1541 emulation mode.  </p>

            <p> Since version 0.12.0.8, you can attach a disk image
              even if it is on a read-only file system or you do not
              have write permissions for it.  When this happens, the
              1541 emulator will emulate a write-protected disk.  This
              is also useful if you want to preserve certain disk image
              from being written to; in the latter case, just remove the
              write permission for that file, e.g. doing a <tt>chmod
                a-w</tt>. </p>

            <p> It is also possible to attach compressed disk or tape
              images; the compression format is recognized from the file
              extension.  The following formats are supported (the
              expected file name extension is in parenthesis): </p>

	    <ul>

	      <li> GNU Zip (<tt>.gz</tt> or <tt>.z</tt>);

	      <li> BZip version 2 (<tt>.bz2</tt>);

	      <li> PkZip (<tt>.zip</tt>);

              <li> GNU Zipped TAR archives (<tt>.tar.gz</tt>,
                <tt>.tgz</tt>);

              <li> Zoo (<tt>.zoo</tt>).

	    </ul> <p> PkZip, <tt>tar.gz</tt>, <tt>lha</tt> and
              <tt>zoo</tt> support is <em>read-only</em> and always
              uses the <em>first</em> <tt>T64</tt> or <tt>D64</tt>
              file in the archive.  So archives containing multiple
              files will always be handled as if they contained one
              single file. </p>

	  <li> <b>Change Working Directory...</b>

	    <p> While devices 8, 9 and 10 are connected to virtual 1541
	      disk drives that are suitable for use with disk images,
	      device 11 is always connected to a virtual drive that
	      accesses the standard (UNIX) file system.  By using this
	      option, you can specify the path where the files are
	      read or written. </p>

	  <li> <b>Activate the Monitor</b>

	    <p> The VICE emulators all have a built-in ML monitor, and
	      this option activates it.  See
	      <a href="#usage-emulators-monitor">below</a> for a complete
	      description of the monitor commands. </p>

	  <li> <b>Activate the XDebugger</b>

	    <p> The XDebugger is a simple X11-based tool that allows
	      you to examine and disassemble the memory contents (still
	      under construction, see
	      <a href="#usage-emulators-xdebugger">below</a> for a complete
	      description of the XDebugger). </p>

	  <li> <b>Run C1541</b>

	    <p> Run the stand-alone <tt>c1541</tt> utility, that must be
	      found somewhere in your <tt>$PATH</tt> (see
	      <a href="#usage-c1541">below</a> for a complete description of
	      <tt>c1541</tt>). </p>

	  <li> <b>Browse manuals</b>

	    <p> View the documentation using the browser specified in the
	      <tt>HTMLBrowserCommand</tt> resource, whose default value is
	      <tt>netscape %s</tt> (see
	      <a href="#usage-emulators-resources">below</a> to know how this
	      can be changed). </p>

	  <li> <b>Reset</b>

	    <p> This submenu allows you to reset the emulated
	      machine.  There are two commands in the submenu: ``Soft
	      Reset'' simply resets the machine by bringing the RESET
	      line down (as a "standard" hardware Reset switch would
	      do), while ``Hard Reset'' also resets the RAM as after a
	      power-up.  A hard reset can also be performed anytime
	      by pressing <tt>F12</tt>. </p>

	    <p> Notice that some programs are designed to ignore a
	      simple reset and that some games <em>might not work</em>
	      if the RAM is not completely initialized (eg. ``Q*Bert'').
	      In such cases, you <em>must</em> use the ``Power-On
	      Reset'' function instead of just a ``Reset''. </p>

	  <li> <b>Exit</b>

	    <p> Exit the emulator.  If the <em> save settings on exit
	      </em> option is set and settings have changed, it will ask
	      you whether you want to save them. </p>

	  <li> <b>Pause</b>

	    <p> Pause the emulation.  Select this option again to
	      restart. </p>

	  <li> <b>About...</b>

	    <p> Show copyright information, contributors, and
	      copying license. </p>

	</ul>

      <li> <b>Option menu:</b> (right button)

	<p>
	<ul>

	  <li> <b>Refresh Rate</b>

	    <p> With this settings, you can control whether the emulator
	      repaints all the frames or not.  With the 1/1 setting,
	      all frames are repainted and animations are rendered as
	      accurately as possible, but this can be too slow for
	      certain machines.  Lower settings such as <tt>1/2</tt>
	      or <tt>1/3</tt> make animations less smooth but also
	      need much less computing power. </p>

	    <p> If a maximum speed limit has been specified, you can use
	      the ``auto'' setting that makes the emulator dynamically
	      adapt to the speed of the host machine, trying to reach
	      the specified speed limit and skipping frames only if
	      necessary.  If this setting is enabled, the emulator
	      will never skip more than 10 consecutive frames, so the
	      result will never be worse than using the <tt>1/10</tt>
	      setting. </p>

	    <p> Warning: it is possible that the actual refresh rate you
	      get with the ``auto'' setting is worse than the one you
	      could get with a fixed refresh rate setting and 100%
	      speed. </p>

	  <li> <b>Maximum Speed</b>

	    <p> Specify the maximum emulation speed, relative to the
	      real machine.  You can also enable full speed operation
	      (i.e. the emulator runs as fast as possible), but this
	      will make the `auto' refresh setting no longer
	      available. </p>

	  <li> <b>Sprite-Sprite Collisions</b> <em> (x64 only) </em>
	  <li> <b>Sprite-Background Collisions</b> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	    <p> These can be used to enable or disable the internal
	      sprite-sprite and sprite-background collision registers.
	      Disabling these registers will make you invincible in
	      some games (but sometimes also your enemies become
	      invincible <tt>:-)</tt>). </p>

	  <li> <b>Joystick device in port 1</b> <em> (x64, Linux with
	      joystick support only) </em>
	  <li> <b>Joystick device in port 2</b> <em> (x64, Linux with
	      joystick support only) </em>

	    <p>With these options, you can specify which devices should
	      be used for the two joystick ports.  The available
	      settings are ``None'', ``Analog Joystick 0'', ``Analog
	      Joystick 1'', ``Digital Joystick 0'', ``Digital Joystick
	      1'', ``Numpad''.  These are only available if the
	      configure script detected a supported joystick
	      driver. </p>

	  <li> <b>Enable Numpad Joystick</b> <em> (xpet only) </em>

	    <p> Enables and Disables the numeric keypad joystick emulation
	      for the PET emulator.</p>

	  <li> <b>Numpad joystick port</b> <em> (x64, xpet, non-Linux
	      systems or Linux systems without joystick support only) </em>

	    <p> If no joystick support is available on your machine (or
	      was not available when the executable was built, or VICE
	      does not support it), you can only emulate joysticks
	      using the numeric keypad.  The arrow keys emulate the
	      four directions, while the 0 and right Ctrl emulate the
	      Fire button. </p>

	  <li> <b>Swap joystick ports</b> <em> (x64, xpet) </em>

	    <p> This swaps the two joystick devices.  It can also be
	      done by pressing <tt>F11</tt>. </p>

	  <li> <b>Video Cache</b>

	    <p> Enable/disable the video cache.  The video cache is used
	      to avoid recalculating those parts of the screen that
	      have not changed since last update; it can give a great
	      performance boost in text mode and when there are not
	      too many animations on the screen, but it can also just
	      slow things down if the X server is very fast and the
	      screen changes a lot.  If the MITSHM extensions are not
	      available on the machine you are using (e.g. you are
	      running on a networked X-terminal), you should probably
	      always keep this enabled. </p>

	  <li> <b>Double Size</b>

	    <p> This option increases the size of the emulation window.
	      It can slow things down a lot, so beware!  If you have a
	      slow machine running Linux and XFree, you can probably
	      achieve better results by changing the XFree screen size
	      with <tt>Ctrl-Alt-+</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-Alt--</tt>.  If
	      you use double size, you will probably have to turn the
	      video cache on to obtain decent performance. </p>

	    <p> On the PET 8032 emulator, only the height is doubled,
	      thus giving the a more correct aspect ratio to the PET
	      screen. </p>

	    <p> You have to enable double size to obtain dithering
	      when you are running on a monochrome X11 display. </p>

	  <li> <b>Double Scan</b>

	    <p> If this option is disabled and double size is enabled,
	      only half of the lines are painted and the rest is kept
	      black.  This makes the emulator faster, and gives an
	      old-stylish look to the window, but is also uglier to
	      see. </p>

	  <li> <b>Use XSync()</b>

	    <p> If this option is enabled, when the emulation window is
	      updated the emulator will always wait for the X server
	      to complete the operation by using the <tt>XSync()</tt>
	      call.  Otherwise, it will simply perform the request and
	      go on without waiting for the server to do its job, and
	      the emulator and the X11 server processes will be
	      executed in parallel for a short period of time.
	      Keeping this option disabled can give a speed boost, but
	      can also cause bad responsiveness to keyboard and mouse
	      events as the X server is being constantly flooded (with
	      double size windows, you might even have troubles
	      opening the pop-up menus, especially if the X server is
	      not very fast).  The effect of this option is
	      particularly noticeable when the video cache is
	      disabled. </p>

	  <li> <b>True 1541 emulation</b> <em> (x64 and xvic only) </em>

	    <p> This option toggles the <em>hardware-level</em> 1541
	      disk drive emulation, as explained in the <a
	      href="#overview-diskdrive">overview</a> section.  Be
	      sure to use this option only if necessary, as keeping it
	      disabled makes things much faster.  Notice that with
	      this option turned on, only drive 8 is emulated, while
	      devices 9, 10 and 11 are disabled completely. </p>

	  <li> <b>True 1541 sync factor</b> <em> (x64 and xvic only) </em>

	    <p> On the real C64/VIC20, the drive clock frequency is
	      different from the one of the computer and VICE takes
	      account of this.  You can select if you want PAL,
	      NTSC or a custom frequency ratio.  The sync value is
	      calculated as follows: </p>

	    <ul>
		<samp>

		  <tt> True1541SyncFactor = 65536 * clk_1541 /
		  clk_[c64|vic20] </tt>

		</samp>
	    </ul>

	    <p> where <tt>clk_1541</tt> is the 1541 clock (about 1 MHz),
	      while <tt>clk_c64</tt> and <tt>clk_vic20</tt> depend on
	      the model being used (PAL or NTSC). For example,
	      <tt>65536</tt> makes the drive run as fast as the
	      computer, <tt>65540</tt> makes the drive faster,
	      <tt>65530</tt> makes the computer faster. </p>

	    <p> The standard values are: </p>

	    <p>
	    <ul>

		<li> VIC20: <tt> 59126 </tt> (PAL) or <tt> 64079 </tt>
		(NTSC)

		<li> C64: <tt> 65516 </tt> (PAL) or <tt> 64094 </tt>
		(NTSC)

	    </ul>
	    </p>

	    <p> Though the VICE emulators emulate only PAL (European)
	      machines, the NTSC setting can sometimes make many
	      fast-loaders that are designed for NTSC machines
	      work. </p>

	  <li> <b>True 1541 idle method</b> <em> (x64 and xvic only) </em>

	    <p> In order to save CPU resources, the 1541 drive emulation
	      is disabled when not strictly necessary.  With this
	      option you can select <em>when</em> it is disabled. </p>

	    <p>
	    <ul>

	      <p> <li> <b>Skip Cycles</b>: Each time the serial line is
		accessed by the C64, the drive executes all the cycles
		since the last time it was running.  If the number of
		elapsed cycles is larger than a certain value, the drive
		discards part of them. </p>

	      <p> <li> <b>Trap Idle</b>: The disk drive is still emulated
	        upon serial line accesses as with the previous option,
	        but it is also always emulated at the end of each screen
		frame.  If the drive gets into the DOS idle loop, only
		pending interrupts are emulated to save time. </p>

	    </ul>
	    </p>

	    <p> The first option (``Skip cycles'') is usually better
	      for performance, as the drive is emulated as little as
	      possible; on the other hand, you can notice sudden
	      slowdowns (when the drive executes several cycles at once)
	      and you never know the LED status correctly.  Moreover, if
	      the drive tries to get in sync with the computer in some
	      weird way and the computer does not access the serial line
	      for a long time, it is possible that some cycles are
	      discarded and the sync is lost.  Notice that this hack can
	      have no effect on performance if one program continuously
	      reads the CIA ports, as the drive will have to be emulated
	      in any case. </p>

	    <p> The second option (``Trap idle'') is usually a bit slower,
	      as at least interrupts are always emulated, but allows the
	      LED state to be always updated correctly and always keeps
	      the 1541 and the computer in sync.  On the other hand, if
	      a program installs a non-standard idle loop in the drive,
	      the 1541 CPU has to be emulated even when not necessary
	      and the global emulation speed is then <em>much</em>
	      slower. </p>

	  <li> <b>Sound</b>

	    <p> This can be used to enable or disable the sound
	      support. </p>

	    <p> <strong> Important notice: </strong> The VIC20 and PET sound
	      emulations are still at the experimental stage. </p>

	  <li> <b>Sound Sample Rate</b>

	    <p> Specify the sample rate, in Hz, for the sound
	      emulation.  Standard values are <tt>8000</tt>,
	      <tt>11025</tt>, <tt>22050</tt>, <tt>44100</tt> and
	      <tt>48000</tt>.  Higher values are obviously slower, so
	      don't try to use the 48KHz setting unless your machine can
	      really handle it. </p>

	  <li> <b>Sound Buffer Size</b>

	    <p> Specify the sound buffer size in seconds.  The optimal
	      sound buffer size depends greatly on the system
	      performance, system load and the program running in the
	      emulator.  Using a higher value gives a longer delay but
	      can be handled better by slower machines. </p>

	  <li> <b>Sound Speed Adjustment</b>

	    <p> Enables/disables the automatic sound speed adjustment.
	      When this feture is turned on, the sound driver tries to
	      adapt the speed of the sound output to the speed of the
	      emulator, slowing it down or speeding it up if the
	      relative speed is not 100%.  Although this allows you to
	      run the emulator at most speeds without clicking, it can
	      interfere with the automatic refresh rate setting and
	      give irregular frame skipping if the speed is less than
	      100%.  On the other hand, disabling it gives clicks if the
	      speed is less than 100% and the emulator can never run
	      above 100% speed. </p>

	  <li> <b>Sound Suspend Time</b>

	    <p> The possible values for this setting are <tt>keep
              going</tt> or <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>, <tt>5</tt> or <tt>10
	      second suspend</tt>.  With <tt>keep going</tt>, the sound
	      driver always produces output even if the emulator is too
	      slow and it `clicks'.  If you select one of the other
	      options, instead, sound is temporarily turned off for the
	      specified amount of seconds if clicks occur. </p>

	  <li> <b>I/O Extensions at $DF00</b> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	    <p> There are 3 available extensions: </p>

	    <ul>

	      <li> <p> <b>IEEE488</b> interface emulator, that
		  emulates the original Commodore IEEE488 interface; for
		  example, it can be used to run
		  <a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fachat">André
		    Fachat's OS/A65 multitasking operating system</a>. (But
		  the OS now also runs on the True1541 emulation) </p>

	      <li> <p> <b>Emulation identification</b>: this is a
		  standard emulator identification extension that was
		  proposed by Wolfgang Lorentz (author of PC64).  With
		  this option turned on, the unused I/O area at
		  <tt>$DF00</tt> is used to store some emulator and
		  copyright information, and certain programs might not
		  like it; </p>

	      <li> <p> <b>512K RAM Expansion Unit</b>: emulate a 512K
		  REU. (this can be used with a few applications that
		  support it) </p>

	    </ul>

	    <p> Notice that you cannot enable more than one option at
	    once in this case, as they could cause conflicts. </p>

	  <li> <b>Save Settings</b>
	  <li> <b>Load Settings</b>
	  <li> <b>Restore Default Settings</b>
	  <li> <b>Save Settings On Exit</b>

	    <p> These options can be used to save and retrieve settings.
	      If the ``Save Settings on Exit'' option is enabled and
	      the resources have been changed the emulator will ask
	      you whether you want to save them before exiting. </p>

	    <p> Notice that, although all options are stored in
	      <tt>~/.vicerc</tt>, saving the values does not destroy
	      the settings for other emulators.  See <a

    <h4> <a name="usage-emulators-resources"> 2.1.3. The <tt> .vicerc
	</tt> configuration file and the command-line options </a> </h4>

    <p> When started, the emulator will search for a <tt>.vicerc</tt>
      configuration file in your <tt>$HOME</tt> directory
      (<tt>VICERC</tt> in the current directory on MS-DOS).  On UNIX, if
      this is not found it will also try to find a <tt>vicerc</tt> file
      in your installation directory (usually something like
      <tt>/usr/local/lib/vice</tt>).  If they are both unavailable, the
      settings will be set to the default values.  After the settings
      are initialized, the emulator parses the command line; this allows
      you to override the values found in the configuration file. </p>

    <p> The configuration file contains the settings for all the
      emulators; this is achieved by dividing the file into
      emulator-specific sections.  Each section begins with the name
      of the related emulator in brackets, i.e. one of these: </p>

    <ul>

	<li> <tt> [C64] </tt>
	<li> <tt> [VIC20] </tt>
	<li> <tt> [PET] </tt>

    </ul>

    <p> This setup makes it possible for you to edit the configuration
      file with a text editor. </p>

    <p> The resources for one emulator must be specified in the
    following form: </p>

    <ul> <tt> ResourceName=ResourceValue </tt> </ul>

    <p> There can be spaces between the <tt>ResourceValue</tt> and the
      `<tt>=</tt>' symbol, and they will not be included in the value.
      If you want to force them, you must put the ResourceValue
      between double quotes (<tt>"..."</tt>). </p>

    <p> All the resources have command-line counterparts, but some command-line
      options are not available as resources.  Here is a list of all the
      command-line options (in parenthesis, you'll find the name of the
      corresponding resource specification if available): </p>

    <ul>

      <li> <tt> -directory PATH (Directory="PATH") </tt>

	<p> Specify the directory where the VICE support files are.
	  Default is none (auto detect). </p>

      <li> <tt> -9 FILENAME </tt>
      <li> <tt> -10 FILENAME </tt>

	<p>Specify the names of the disk images to attach to devices 8, 9 and

      <li> <tt> -1 FILENAME </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	<p> Specify a tape image in T64 format to attach at startup (device 1).
        </p>

      <li> <tt> -autostart FILENAME </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	<p> Attach <tt>FILENAME</tt>, trying to autodetect its type, and
	  autostart it. </p>

      <li> <tt> -joyport NUM (JoyPort=N) </tt> <em> (x64 only, if no hardware
	  joystick support available) </em>

	<p> Specify in which port the joystick emulated via numeric
	  keypad should be. </p>

      <li> <tt> -joydev1 NUM (JoyDevice1=NUM) </tt> <em> (x64 only, if hardware
	  joystick support is available) </em>
      <li> <tt> -joydev2 NUM (JoyDevice2=NUM) </tt> <em> (x64 only, if hardware
	  joystick support is available) </em>

	<p> Specify the joystick device for ports 1 and 2, respectively.
	  <tt>NUM</tt> can be one of the following: </p>

	<p>
	<ul>

	  <li> <tt> 0 </tt> (none)

	  <li> <tt> 1 </tt> Analog Joystick #0

	  <li> <tt> 2 </tt> Analog Joystick #1

	  <li> <tt> 3 </tt> Digital Joystick #0

	  <li> <tt> 4 </tt> Digital Joystick #1

	</ul>
	</p>

      <li> <tt> -speed SPEED (Speed=SPEED) </tt>

	<p> Specify the maximum percentage speed for the emulator
	  (e.g. <tt>100</tt> gives exact speed, if possible).
	  <tt>0</tt> specifies that no speed limit is desired and
	  makes the emulator run as fast as possible. </p>

      <li> <tt> -refresh N (RefreshRate=N) </tt>

	<p> Specify than only one for each <tt>N</tt> frames must be
	  recalculated.  If <tt>N</tt> is equal to <tt>0</tt>, then
	  the value is automatically adjusted to obtain the maximum
	  speed specified.  (This cannot be done if <tt>Speed</tt> is
	  set to <tt>0</tt>, i.e. no speed limit) </p>

      <li> <tt> -dsize (DoubleSize=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +dsize (DoubleSize=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) double size window.
	  If you are running on a monochrome X11 server, you should
	  enable double size in order to enable the dithering. </p>

      <li> <tt> -dscan (DoubleScan=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +dscan (DoubleScan=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) double scan.  If
	  double scan is disabled and double size is enabled, only one
	  each 2 lines is actually repainted, and the others are left
	  black. </p>

      <li> <tt> -vcache (VideoCache=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +vcache (VideoCache=0) </tt>

	<p>Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) the video cache.  This is
	  enabled by default. </p>

      <li> <tt> -install (PrivateColormap=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +install (PrivateColormap=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) usage of a private
	  colormap.  This must be used when the emulator runs out of
	  colors and thus cannot initialize the colormap correctly.
	  When the option is enabled, it will use its own colormap
	  instead of trying to allocate the colors on the default one:
	  this will cause flashing when entering or leaving the
	  emulation window but will also allow it to always have the
	  correct colors. </p>

      <li> <tt> -sound (Sound=1) </tt> <li> <tt> +sound (Sound=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) the sound support. </p>

      <li> <tt> -soundrate N (SoundSampleRate=N) </tt>

	<p> Specify the sample rate for sound emulation in Hz. </p>

      <li> <tt> -sounddev NAME (SoundDeviceName=NAME) </tt> <br>
      <li> <tt> -soundarg ARG (SoundDeviceArg=ARG) </tt>

	<p> Specify one sound device and one (optional) argument for the
	  device driver.  If no device is specified or <tt>NAME</tt>
	  is an empty string, the emulator selects a supported sound
	  device automatically.  Available sound devices are: </p>

	<ul>

	  <li> <tt>uss</tt>

	    <p> Standard Linux/FreeBSD USS sound driver;
	      the argument specifies the sound device file name
	      (<tt>/dev/dsp</tt> is the default). </p>

	  <li> <tt>sgi</tt>

	    <p> Silicon Graphics audio support; the argument specifies
	      the sound device file name (<tt>/dev/audio</tt> by
	      default). </p>

	  <li> <tt>sun</tt>

	    <p> Solaris audio support (unfinished); the argument specifies the
	      sound device file name (<tt>/dev/audio</tt> by default). </p>

	  <li> <tt>hpux</tt>

	    <p> HP-UX audio support (unfinished); the argument
	      specifies the sound device file name (<tt>/dev/audio</tt>
	      by default). </p>

          <li> <tt>aix</tt>

            <p> AIX audio support. </p>

          <li> <tt>sdl</tt>

            <p> Simple DirectMedia Layer audio support. </p>

	  <li> <tt>fs</tt>

	    <p> Write samples to a file; the argument specifies the file name
	      (<code>vicesnd.raw</code> by default). </p>

	  <li> <tt>dummy</tt>

	    <p> Fully emulate the SID, but do not actually play
	      samples. </p>

	  <li> <tt>speed</tt>

	    <p> Similar to <tt>dummy</tt>, but also calculates
	      samples.  This is used to evaluate the speed of the sample
	      generator. </p>

	  <li> <tt>dump</tt> <br>

	    <p> Dump all register write accesses to a file for
	      debugging; the argument specifies the file name
	      (<tt>vicesnd.sid</tt> by default). </p>

	</ul>

	<p> Obviously, not all of them might be available on your
	  system. </p>

      <li> <tt> -soundspeedadj (SoundSpeedAdjustment=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +soundspeedadj (SoundSpeedAdjustment=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) automatic sound speed
	  adjustment. </p>

      <li> <tt> -soundsuspend N (SoundSuspendTime=N) </tt>

	<p>Turn sound off for <tt>N</tt> seconds if the emulator is too slow and
	  sound ``clicks''. </p>

      <li> <tt> -saveres (SaveResourcesOnExit=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +saveres (SaveResourcesOnExit=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) saving of resources
	  when exiting the emulator (you will be asked first). </p>

      <li> <tt> -1541 (True1541=1) </tt> <em> (x64 and xvic only) </em>
      <li> <tt> +1541 (True1541=0) </tt> <em> (x64 and xvic only) </em>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) the <em>slower</em>
	  hardware-level 1541 disk drive emulation.  By default, the
	  <em>fast</em> 1541 emulation is used. </p>

      <li> <tt> -dosname NAME (DosName=NAME) </tt> <em> (x64 and xvic only)
	</em>

	<p> Specify the 1541 ROM image name.  Default value is
	  <tt>dos1541</tt>. </p>

      <li> <tt> -driveidle N (True1541IdleMethod=N) </tt>
	<em> (x64 and xvic only) </em>

	<p> Specify a method to disable the 1541 emulation when not
	  necessary. 0 stands for `skip cycles', 1 for `trap idle' (see
	  above for an explanation of what this means).  The default is
	  1.</p>

      <li> <tt> -drivesync N (True1541SyncFactor=N) </tt>
	<em> (x64 and xvic only) </em>

      <li> <tt> -paldrive (True1541SyncFactor=65516 (C64) or

	</em>

	<p> Specify the drive/computer clock ratio in 1/65536ths.  The standard
          values are <tt>66516</tt> for PAL and <tt>64094</tt> for NTSC on the
          C64, <tt>59126</tt> for PAL and <tt>64079</tt> for NTSC on the
          VIC20.  The default setting is PAL. </p>

      <li> <tt> -htmlbrowser COMMAND (HTMLBrowserCommand=COMMAND) </tt>

	<p> Specify the name of an HTML browser for consulting the on-line
          documentation.  You can also specify command-line options as you
          would normally do from a shell.  The string <tt>%s</tt> in
          <tt>COMMAND</tt> will be automatically replaced with the name of the
          file containing the manual page (VICE must be correctly installed to
          make this work correctly). </p>

	<p> This feature allows you to issue any command you like to browse the
	  documentation; for example, instead of running a new browser whenever
	  you want to read the manual, you can remotely issue commands to an
	  already running browser (for example, Netscape Navigator supports
	  this with the <tt>-remote</tt> option). </p>

	<p> The default value is <tt>netscape %s</tt>. </p>

      <li> <tt> <a name="petmodel">-model MODEL</a> </tt> <em> (xpet only) </em>

	<p> Specify the PET model to emulate. </p>

      <li> <tt> -memory M (MemoryExp=M) </tt> <em> (xvic only) </em>

	<p> Specify the RAM expansions for the VIC20 emulation.  You
	  must specify a comma separated list of options that can be one
	  of the following: </p>

	<ul>

	  <li> <samp>none</samp> no extension

	  <li> <samp>all</samp> all blocks

	  <li> <samp>3k</samp> 3k space in block 0

	  <li> <samp>8k</samp> 1st 8k extension block

	  <li> <samp>16k</samp> 1st and 2nd 8k extension blocks

	  <li> <samp>24k</samp> 1st, 2nd and 3rd extension blocks

	  <li> <samp>0, 1, 2, 3, 5</samp> memory in respective blocks

	  <li> <samp>04, 20, 40, 60, A0</samp> memory at respective address

	</ul>

	<p> Examples: </p>

	<p>
	<ul>

	  <li> <samp> xvic -memory "" </samp> <br>
            gives unexpanded VIC20.

	  <li> <samp> xvic -memory 60,a0 </samp> <br>
            enables memory in blocks 3 and 5, which is the usual configuration
            for 16k ROM modules.

	</ul>
	</p>

      <li> <tt> -mitshm (Mitshm=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +mitshm (Mitshm=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) usage of the MITSHM
	  extensions.  These extensions allow much faster performance
	  if the program runs on the console, but are not available on
	  all systems and cannot be used if you are running on a
	  networked X-terminal.  If the MITSHM extensions were not
	  found when compiling the program, this option will have no
	  effect and usage of the extensions will always be
	  disabled. </p>

      <li> <tt> -displaydepth N (DisplayDepth=N) </tt>

	<p> Specify the X11 display depth.  If not specified, it tries
	  to find it out automatically.  </p>

      <li> <tt> -xsync (UseXSync=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +xsync (UseXSync=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) usage of the
	  <tt>XSync()</tt> call when the contents of the video frame buffer
	  are blitted to the emulation window.  Keeping this enabled will give
	  slower performance but better X11 responsiveness. </p>

      <li> <tt> -kernal NAME (KernalName=NAME) </tt>
      <li> <tt> -basic NAME (BasicName=NAME) </tt> <em> (x64 and xvic only)
        </em>

	<p> Specify the name of the Kernal and Basic ROM image names.
	  The PET ROM image contains both kernal and basic. </p>

      <li> <tt> -petromBasic NAME (PetRomBasic=NAME) </tt> <em> (xpet only)
        </em>
      <li> <tt> -petromEditor NAME (PetRomEditor=NAME) </tt> <em> (xpet only)

      <li> <tt> -petrom9 NAME (PetRom9=NAME) </tt> <em> (xpet only) </em>
      <li> <tt> -petromA NAME (PetRomA=NAME) </tt> <em> (xpet only) </em>
      <li> <tt> -petromB NAME (PetRomB=NAME) </tt> <em> (xpet only) </em>

	<p> Specify the names of the PET extension ROM images for the
          address <tt>$9***</tt>, <tt>$A***</tt> and <tt>$B***</tt> resp.
	  </p>

      <li> <tt> -petram9 </tt> <em> (xpet only) </em>
      <li> <tt> -petramA </tt> <em> (xpet only) </em>

	<p> Enables the CBM 8296 RAM mapping for the addresses $9***
	  and $A*** resp.

      <li> <tt> -ram NAME (ramName=NAME) </tt>

	<p> Specify a RAM image name to load at startup.  If not
	  specified, RAM is reset as after a power up. </p>

      <li> <tt> -hex (Hex=1) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +hex (Hex=0) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) hexadecimal notation
	  in monitor.  This is enabled by default </p>

      <li> <tt> -traps (NoTraps=0) </tt>
      <li> <tt> +traps (NoTraps=1) </tt>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) the kernal traps.
	  ``Traps'' are patches that are applied to the operating
	  system to allow certain operations.  If serial traps are
	  disabled, you cannot use the fast DOS-level 1541 emulation
	  or the T64 tape images, but you are using the raw Kernal ROM
	  without any modifications.  The traps are enabled by
	  default, and you probably need to disable them if you are
	  going to use alternative ROM images. </p>

      <li> <tt> -ieee488 (IEEE488=1) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>
      <li> <tt> +ieee488 (IEEE488=0) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) the IEEE488 interface
	  emulation.  This is disabled by default. </p>

      <li> <tt> -emuid (EmuID=1) </tt>  <em> (x64 only) </em>
      <li> <tt> +emuid  (EmuID=0) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) the emulator identification
	  feature.  This is enabled by default. </p>

      <li> <tt> -checkss (CheckSsColl=1) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

      <li> <tt> +checksb (CheckSbColl=0) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	<p> Enable(<tt>-</tt>)/disable(<tt>+</tt>) the sprite/sprite and
	  sprite/background collision registers respectively.  These are
	  all enabled by default.  </p>

      <li> <tt> -kernalrev N (KernalRev=N) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	<p> VICE can transform one ROM revision into another by
	  patching the ROM image after it has been loaded.  There are 4
	  available revisions, <tt>0</tt>, <tt>3</tt>, <tt>100</tt> and
	  <tt>67</tt>.  <tt>0</tt> and <tt>3</tt> refer to the standard
	  C64, while <tt>67</tt> refers to the SX64 (portable model) and
	  <tt>100</tt> to the Educator 64 (also known as PET4064).  As
	  the hardware of the corresponding machines is almost the same,
	  you can thus emulate all of them just by using this
	  option. </p>

	<p> The default is no patching (i.e. <tt>KernalRev</tt> is an empty
	  string). </p>

      <li> <tt> -reu (REU=1) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>
      <li> <tt> +reu (REU=0) </tt> <em> (x64 only) </em>

	<p> Enable or disable the external 512K RAM Expansion Unit. </p>

    </a> </h4>

    <p> (Warning: the XDebugger is still under construction, and is not
      100% functional yet). </p>

    <p> When the XDebugger is enabled, a new window pops up. On the
      left it shows the opcode the CPU is working on, while on the right
      several register contents are displayed. </p>

    <p> Below the registers is the status line. It shows the status of
      the emulator. It can be <tt>Running</tt>, <tt>Halted</tt> or
      <tt>Trace</tt>.  You can switch between the states with the
      buttons below the status line.  <tt>Run</tt> lifts off the CPU,
      <tt>Stop</tt> halts it, and <tt>Trace</tt> lets it run with
      displaying the executed opcodes in the left window. </p>

    <p> When the emulator is stopped, it is possible to run single-step
      execution by pushing the <tt>Step</tt> button. </p>

    <p> With the <tt>Skip</tt> button the next opcode to be executed can
      be skipped. This way <tt>JAM</tt> (i.e. illegal) opcodes can
      easily be used to trap a program and then be skipped here. </p>

    <h3> <a name="usage-c1541"> 2.2. Using <tt>c1541</tt> </a> </h3>

    <p> <tt>c1541</tt> is a stand-alone disk image maintenance
      program.  It can be used both interactively and from the command
      line. </p>

    <p> The syntax is: </p>

    <ul>
	<samp>

	  c1541 [OPTIONS] [IMAGE]

	</samp>
    </ul>

    <p> If some <tt>OPTIONS</tt> but no <tt>IMAGE</tt> is specified,
      <tt>c1541</tt> runs in batch mode; otherwise, it attaches the
      <tt>IMAGE</tt> if present and enters the interactive mode, where
      you can type commands that are executed when you press Enter
      (abbreviations are allowed).  As with the monitor, file name
      completion and command line editing with history are provided. Use
      <tt>quit</tt> to exit. </p>

    <p> Notice that <tt>c1541</tt> always creates <tt>X64</tt> files,
      but can read and write <tt>D64</tt> files automatically, without
      the need for any special options. </p>

    <p> Each command-line option has an interactive-mode counterpart,
      that is shown in parenthesis: (abbreviations are allowed when
      not ambiguous) </p>

    <ul>

      <li> <tt> -attach IMAGE (attach IMAGE) </tt>

	<p> Attach the disk image <tt>IMAGE</tt> for use.  All

      <li> <tt> -create IMAGE DUMP ['DESCR'] (create IMAGE DUMP
      ['DESCR']) </tt>

	<p> Build <tt>IMAGE</tt> from raw dump file <tt>DUMP</tt> (i.e. convert
	  from <tt>D64</tt> to <tt>X64</tt> file). </p>

      TAPEIMAGE [FILES...])  </tt>

	<p> Transfer <tt>FILES</tt> from <tt>TAPEIMAGE</tt> to <tt>IMAGE</tt>
	  (default is copy all files). </p>

      <li> <tt> -read IMAGE 1541NAME [FSNAME] (read 1541NAME [FSNAME])
        </tt>

	<p> Extract <tt>1541NAME</tt> from the disk image into <tt>FSNAME</tt>

      <li> <tt> -extract IMAGE (extract) </tt>

	<p> Extract all files from <tt>IMAGE</tt>. </p>

    <p> VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X
      Window System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were
      mostly involved in the development of X64 and VICE: </p>

	  <br>

	  Gave lots of information and bug reports about the VIC-II,
	  the 6510 and the CIAs; moreover, he wrote several
	  test-routines that were used to improve the emulation.  Also
	  contributed some important patches, fixed some problems in
	  the 1541 emulation and added BZIP v2 support. <p>

      <li> <p> <b>Michael Schwendt</b> <tt> (<a href="mailto:sidplay@geocities.com">sidplay@geocities.com</a>) </tt> <br>

    </ul>

    <p> Also the public patches and beta releases will be available
      there as well, so you might want to have a look at it
      periodically.  If you are going to report a bug, please check
      those pages first; it is possible that the problem you encountered
      has already been fixed with a newer version. </p>

    <p> If you want to report bugs, make suggestions or contribute to
      the project, please email one of the following people: </p>

    <p>
    <ul>

      <li> Teemu Rantanen
	(<tt><a href="mailto:tvr@cs.hut.fi">tvr@cs.hut.fi</a></tt>)
	for the sound stuff;

      <li> André Fachat
	(<tt><a href="mailto:fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de">fachat@physik.tu-chemnitz.de</a></tt>)
	for the PETs;

      <li> Ettore Perazzoli
	(<tt><a href="mailto:ettore@comm2000.it">ettore@comm2000.it</a></tt>),
	the current maintainer, for everything else.

    <p> Please put the word <tt>VICE</tt> <em>in all capitals</em> in
      your subject line (e.g. <tt>VICE fails to run game XXX</tt>).
      This helps mail splitting and reduces chances that your message is
      unintentionally deleted, forgotten or lost. </p>

    <p> When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as
      possible and describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.
      You should also tell us what machine you are running on, what
      operating system you are using as well as the version of it. </p>

    <p> In any case, we would <em>really</em> be glad to receive your
      comments about VICE. </p>

    <p> If you want to contribute, please <em>ask</em> first.  It has
      already happened a couple of times that somebody started working
      at something that had already been done but not released to the
      public, and we really do <em>not</em> want anybody to waste time.
    </p>

    <p> People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always
      welcome.  In particular, we would be really glad if somebody
      ported VICE to MacOS or Windows NT/95.  A port of the 0.11.0 C64
      emulator for MacOS already exists but it is quite buggy and not
      maintained any longer. </p>
