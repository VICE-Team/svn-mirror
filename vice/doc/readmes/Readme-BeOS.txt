BeVICE
======

REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------
BeVICE was developed and so far tested under BeOS 5 Personal Edition,
Zeta and Haiku.

INSTALLATION
------------------------
No nice package installer so far, just expand the binary archive to 
wherever you like, enter the directory 'vice-1.*' and start your
favourite emulator (x64, x128, xvic, xpet, xplus4, xcbm2).

COMPILATION
-----------------------
If you have the source distribution of VICE and want to build your own
binaries, the following hints may help:
- Install the BeOS development tools; you can get them for free at
  http://www.be.com  
- Expand the source directory vice-1.*
- Start a terminal and enter the source directory
- ./configure
  configures for building BeOS binaries.
- make
  compiles all the stuff and creates the executables in the src subdirectory.
- make bindist
  Makes a binary distribution directory, after the directory has been made
  you can run VICE from within that directory.


BUGS (only the known;)
-------------------------------------
- Sometimes the application loses the keyboard focus; no keystrokes are
  accepted inside the emu, so the emulator has to be restarted.
- I discovered several sound problems on my slower machine (P100) with
  a non-official driver for sb16.
- The monitor only works if you start the emulator from a terminal; if you
  start the emu from tracker and enter the monitor, you are "lost"

TODO
----------
- Some user interfaces for the settings are missing; some machine
  specific setting are missing; use commandline options or
  edit the vice.ini.
- Fullsrceen mode is needed.
