 This is version 3.6.1 of VICE, the multi-platform C64, C128, VIC20,

 Feedback
 --------

 It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE, but please
 read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the team.

 - Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  Please make sure
   you turn off the "rich text" (HTML) feature.

 - Please don't send any binaries without asking first.

 - Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a bug or a
   problem you cannot solve:

    - the VICE documentation (you should have received it with the main
      distribution--if not, tell us);
      Online version - http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_toc.html

    - the VICE wiki at http://vice-emu.pokefinder.org/

 - Before reporting a bug, please try a recent nightly build and check if your
   issue is already fixed. You can fine nightly builds for windows here:
   <SF-uploads via Travis-CI?>

 - When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and describe
   how it can be reproduced to the very detail. You should also tell us what
   machine you are running on, what operating system you are using as well as
   the version of Vice.

 - Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to your PC. To
   transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander (http://sta.c64.org/sc.html).

 - Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the Internet.

 - Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we really
   don't know. We are trying to make at least one release per year, around
   christmas.

 - Please write in English.

 In any case, we would be really glad to receive your comments about VICE.

 The central place for bug reports is the bug tracker at sourceforge:
 https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/bugs/

 At sourceforge you can also submit feature requests:
