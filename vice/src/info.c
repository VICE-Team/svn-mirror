    "all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,\n",
    "then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License\n",
    "would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n",

    "intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\n",
    "in other circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe\n",
    "any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\n",
    "of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of\n",
    "protecting the integrity of the free software distribution\n",
    "system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n",
    "people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\n",
    "software distributed through that system in reliance on\n",
    "consistent application of that system; it is up to the\n",
    "author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n",
    "software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\n",
    "that choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\n",
    "believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n",
    "\n",
    "  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted\n",
    "in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted\n",
    "interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program\n",
    "under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\n",
    "limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is\n",

    "versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such\n",
    "new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n",

    "to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n"

    "    c) If the modified program normally\n"
    "    reads commands interactively when\n"
    "    run, you must cause it, when started\n"
    "    running for such interactive use in\n"
    "    the most ordinary way, to print or\n"
    "    display an announcement including an\n"

    "    notice that there is no warranty (or\n"
    "    else, saying that you provide a\n"

    "\n"
    "    a) Accompany it with the complete\n"
    "    corresponding machine-readable\n"

    "    c) Accompany it with the information\n"
    "    you received as to the offer to\n"
    "    distribute corresponding source\n"
    "    code.  (This alternative is allowed\n"
    "    only for noncommercial distribution\n"
    "    and only if you received the program\n"
    "    in object code or executable form\n"

    "or binary form) with the major\n"
    "components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n"
    "of the operating system on which the\n"
    "executable runs, unless that component\n"
    "itself accompanies the executable.\n"
    "\n"
    "If distribution of executable or object\n"
    "code is made by offering access to copy\n"
    "from a designated place, then offering\n"
    "equivalent access to copy the source\n"
    "code from the same place counts as\n"
    "distribution of the source code, even\n"
    "though third parties are not compelled\n"
    "to copy the source along with the object\n"
    "code.\n"
    "\n"
    "  4. You may not copy, modify,\n"
    "sublicense, or distribute the Program\n"
    "except as expressly provided under this\n"
    "License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,\n"
    "modify, sublicense or distribute the\n"
    "Program is void, and will automatically\n"
    "terminate your rights under this\n"
    "License.  However, parties who have\n"
    "received copies, or rights, from you\n"
    "under this License will not have their\n"
    "licenses terminated so long as such\n"
    "parties remain in full compliance.\n"
    "\n"
    "  5. You are not required to accept this\n"
    "License, since you have not signed it.\n"
    "However, nothing else grants you\n"
    "permission to modify or distribute the\n"
    "Program or its derivative works.  These\n"
    "actions are prohibited by law if you do\n"
    "not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n"
    "modifying or distributing the Program\n"
    "(or any work based on the Program), you\n"
    "indicate your acceptance of this License\n"
    "to do so, and all its terms and\n"
    "conditions for copying, distributing or\n"
    "modifying the Program or works based on\n"
    "it.\n"
    "\n"
    "  6. Each time you redistribute the\n"
    "Program (or any work based on the\n"
    "Program), the recipient automatically\n"
    "receives a license from the original\n"
    "licensor to copy, distribute or modify\n"
    "the Program subject to these terms and\n"
    "conditions.  You may not impose any\n"
    "further restrictions on the recipients'\n"
    "exercise of the rights granted herein.\n"
    "You are not responsible for enforcing\n"
    "compliance by third parties to this\n"
    "License.\n"
    "\n"
    "  7. If, as a consequence of a court\n"
    "judgment or allegation of patent\n"
    "infringement or for any other reason\n"
