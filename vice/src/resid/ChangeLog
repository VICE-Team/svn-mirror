	complete SID state.
	
	* sid.cc (SID::clock): Age bus value. Clock external filter.
	(SID::enable_external_filter): Enable/disable external filter.
	
	* spline.h: Spline implementation. Used to specify mapping from
	the FC register to filter cutoff frequency.

1998-11-14  Dag Lem  <resid@nimrod.no>

	* Version 0.6 released.

	* configure.in: Allow compilation in a separate directory.

	* wave.h (WaveformGenerator::synchronize): Handle special case when a
	sync source is synced itself on the same cycle as its MSB is set
	high.

1998-09-06  Dag Lem  <resid@nimrod.no>

	* Version 0.5 released.

	* version.cc (resid_version_string): Version string with C linkage.
	
	* wave.cc (WaveformGenerator::set_chip_model): Emulation of MOS8580
	combined waveforms.

1998-08-28  Dag Lem  <resid@nimrod.no>

	* Version 0.4 released.

	* envelope.h (EnvelopeGenerator::clock): Count up to rate_period twice
	during ADSR delay bug, and add one extra rate counter step.

	* filter.cc (Filter::bsd_copysign): Renamed copysign function for
	compilation on platforms where copysign is implemented as a macro.
	
1998-08-23  Dag Lem  <resid@nimrod.no>

	* Version 0.3 released.

	* envelope.h (EnvelopeGenerator::clock): Handle ADSR boundary bug.
	
	* envelope.cc (EnvelopeGenerator::rate_counter_period,
	EnvelopeGenerator::exponential_counter_period): Corrected counter
	periods.

	* sid.h (SID::clock): New one-cycle optimized overload of the clock()
	function.
	
	* wave.h (WaveformGenerator::output_P_T): Combined waveform
	pulse+triangle indexing corrected.
	(WaveformGenerator::output_P__): Check for test bit to handle
	pulse+test bit samples.
	(WaveformGenerator::output): Optimized for speed (inlining).

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* envelope.h (EnvelopeGenerator::clock): Start decay cycle immediately
	at envelope counter 0xff. New sustain value is zero if the sustain
	level is raised above the current envelope counter value.
	(EnvelopeGenerator::step_envelope): Handle ADSR delay bug.
	
	* envelope.cc (EnvelopeGenerator::rate_counter_period,
	EnvelopeGenerator::exponential_counter_period): Corrected counter
	periods.
