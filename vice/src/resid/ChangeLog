	function.
	
	* wave.h (WaveformGenerator::output_P_T): Combined waveform

	EnvelopeGenerator::exponential_counter_period): Corrected counter
	periods.
	(EnvelopeGenerator::writeCONTROL_REG): Do not modify rate counter.

	* filter.cc (Filter::set_Q): Constrain Q to keep filter stable.
	
	* sid.h (SID::read, SID::write, SID::bypass_filter): Simplified API
	routing register access through the SID class.
