Changes in reSID version 0.7
----------------------------

The audio output filter in the C64, external to the SID chip, has been
modeled.

The mapping function between the FC register and filter cutoff frequency can
now be specified with spline interpolation points. This facilitates
interactive modification of the mapping function by graphical presentation of
the interpolation curve. The implementation of this novel spline design is
fast and general purpose, and should be well suited for use in other projects
as well.

Filtered output has been inverted compared to unfiltered output.

Aging of the bus value obtained when reading write only registers has been
partly implemented.

To facilitate offline storage the complete state of SID can be read and
written.


Changes in reSID version 0.6
----------------------------

A special case in synchronization has been implemented.

The Autoconf script is cleaned up to allow compilation in a separate directory.


Changes in reSID version 0.5
----------------------------

Emulation of MOS8580 combined waveforms.

Version string resid_version_string provided for e.g. Autoconf tests.
The string has C linkage.


Changes in reSID version 0.4
----------------------------

The implementation of the ADSR delay bug has been refined and should now be
cycle exact.

The patch for VICE has been removed since VICE 0.15 will include reSID support.


Changes in reSID version 0.3
----------------------------

The reSID library has changed name from libmos6581.a to libresid.a

The pulse+sawtooth combined waveform has been corrected.

Pulse+test bit samples are implemented.

The envelope rate periods have finally been exactly determined.

A new SID bug, the ADSR boundary bug, has been discovered and implemented.
This bug makes it possible to step from envelope level 0x00 to 0xff or from
0xff to 0x00 in one step.

One-cycle optimized overloads of the clock() functions have been implemented
to facilitate sampling at 1MHz.

The code has been further optimized for speed.


Changes in reSID version 0.2
----------------------------

The implementation of the Envelope Generator has been rewritten to handle
the infamous ADSR delay bug. All known envelope related bugs have been
corrected.

The maximum filter resonance is lowered to keep the filter stable.

The reSID API has been simplified. Reading write only registers is allowed.
