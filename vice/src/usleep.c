/*
 *  NAME:
 *      usleep     -- This is the precision timer for Test Set
 *                    Automation. It uses the select(2) system
 *                    call to delay for the desired number of
 *                    micro-seconds. This call returns ZERO
 *                    (which is usually ignored) on successful
 *                    completion, -1 otherwise.
 *
 *  ALGORITHM:
 *      1) We range check the passed in microseconds and log a
 *         warning message if appropriate. We then return without
 *         delay, flagging an error.
 *      2) Load the Seconds and micro-seconds portion of the
 *         interval timer structure.
 *      3) Call select(2) with no file descriptors set, just the
 *         timer, this results in either delaying the proper
 *         ammount of time or being interupted early by a signal.
 *
 *  HISTORY:
 *      Added when the need for a subsecond timer was evident.
