	* monitor/mon.c: Corrected the (incorrect) correction
	in is_valid_addr_range() from 2001-03-09; with the wrong
	correction, "m xxxx" gave a memory dump from xxxx to $FFFF.
	The "original" issue ("d 8:c100 c200" was not allowed) is
	now "fixed" be removing an assertion...

2001-03-25  Andreas Boose  <boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de>

2001-03-24  Andre Fachat  <a.fachat@gmx.net>

	* drive/fdc.c (fdc_do_job): do not abort $d0 command (execute

	others work.
	
2001-03-24  Andre Fachat  <a.fachat@gmx.net>

	* arch/unix/x11/xaw/uiedisk.c (save_callback,

	* sound.c (initsid): Don't read speed from resource.
	(sound_flush): Accept changing relative_speed. Definition of

	fragsize*2" - empty buffer was not always detected on
	startup. Fill hardware buffer entirely for cycle_based sound
	and SOUND_ADJUST_EXACT. Tune VICE timer according to current
	buffer overflow, not according to the _largest_ buffer
	overflow during a one second period.
	(sound_set_relative_speed): New function.

	* arch/riscos/ui.{c,h}: keep track of reSID choice, resync
	speed when changing speed settings, take care of
	sound_flush()'s frame delay.

	* arch/riscos/vsync.c: propagate frame delay to ui_poll,
	reordered calls, use different sound_flush() speed parameters
	for SID and reSID.

	* zfile.c: added archdep_file_set_gzip() to compression code.

2001-03-14  Andreas Boose  <boose@linux.rz.fh-hannover.de>

	* Version 1.6.9.

2001-03-11  pottendo  <pottendo@utanet.at>

	* arch/unix/x11/ui-resources.c: Changed callback, when switching
	to fullscreen to `fullscreen_request_set_mode()', as it's bad to
	change to DGA within a (gnome-)callback function. Switching
 	to and from fullscreen now is handled synchronously at vsync
	level. 

	* arch/unix/x11/gnome/gnomekbd.c: Fixed warnings.

	* arch/unix/x11/fullscreen.c: Reworked to make it functional with
	DGA V2 including keyboard support.
	On startup (and not FS_DEBUG set) the program forks via
	`XF86DGAForkApp()'. This is useful as once vice crashs the
	window settings of the X11 server is restored
	automatically. 

	* arch/unix/x11/Makefile.am (EXTRA_libx11ui_a_SOURCES): Added
	fullscreenkbd.c. This file is temporary and will be straightened
	along with further fullscreen work.

	* arch/unix/vsync.c: Call ui event dispatcher via a hook
	function. 
	(vsync_set_event_dispatcher): New function.

	* vsync.h (vsync_set_event_dispatcher): Added prototype.

2001-03-10  Andreas Matthies  <andreas.matthies@gmx.net>

	* vic20/vic.c(vic_raster_draw_alarm_handler) display_xstop is
	checked not to exceed the screen width

2001-03-09  Spiro Trikaliotis  <Spiro.Trikaliotis@gmx.de>

	external_resize_window(), resulting in "garbage" printed at
	the bottom or right side of the console under certain
	circumstances.

	* monitor/mon.c: Deleted (obsolete) maincpu_interface,
	drive8_interface, drive9_interface; corrected an error in
	is_valid_addr_range(), which didn't allow to specify i.e.
	"d 8:c100 c200";

	* monitor/mon.c: Corrected an error with respect to Z80: If
	cpu type was Z80, even a drive's disassembly was in that
	format. For this, changed mon_disassemble_to_string() and
	mon_disassemble_to_string_ex() to take the memspace as
	additional argument.

	* monitor/mon.c: Whenever the monitor is opened,
	uimon_notify_change() is called to notify the arch-dependant
	monitor interface.

	* uimon.h: added functions uimon_notify_change(), and
	uimon_get_in() as a helper function for uimon_in();

	* monitor/mon_util.c, mon_util.h: added.

	* monitor/mon.c: Changed playback_commands() as suggested by
	Michael Klein on 20.12.2000, so the symbol file "c64mem.sym"
	is found even if it is not in the actual directory.

	* monitor/mon.[ch]: Added mon_get_mem_val_ex() which allows to
	specify a different memory bank

	* */uimon.c: Added uimon_get_in(), uimon_notify_change()
	and uimon_set_interface() as dummy-functions...

	* */uimon.c: renamed all arch_mon_... to uimon_...()

2001-03-06  Andreas Dehmel  <dehmel@forwiss.tu-muenchen.de>

	* arch/riscos/ui.{c,h}: changed some static declarations,
	extended help system

	actual speed to sound_flush()

	arch/win32/rescbm2.rc, arch/win32/respet.rc,
	arch/win32/resvic.rc: Added fullscreen menu entries.

	* arch/win32/ui.c: Include fullscreen.h.
	Added 'SaveOnResourcesExit' and 'FullScreenEnabled' to
	toggle_list.
	(ui_resources): New struct, contains resources from the UI.
	(set_fullscreen_device) (set_fullscreen_bitdpeth)
	(set_fullscreen_width) (set_fullscreen_height)

	(set_save_resources_on_exit): New functions.
	(resources): Added fullscreen resources.
	(cmdline_options): Added commandlines.
	(ui_init_cmdline_options): Register commandline options.
	(UI_COMMON_HOTKEYS): Added Alt-D and Alt-Enter hotkeys.
	(ui_init): Updated hotkey numbers, removed unused local
	variable, don't create status window here.
	(ui_init_finish): Call ui_fullscreen_init.
	(ui_open_canvas_window): Added fullscreen stuff.
	(ui_resize_canvas_window): Don't do anything in fullscreen.
	(ui_error) (ui_error_string): Log error message into logfile
	as well.
	(save_sanpshot_trap) (load_snapshot_trap): Suspend fullscreen
	if neccessary.
	(ui_get_main_hwnd): Always have a window handle even when the
	canvas windows hasn't been created yet.
	(handle_wm_command): Suspend fullscreen if neccessary.
	Added fullscreen settings call, and toggle fullscreen handling.
	(window_proc): Handle WM_ACTIVATEAPP message, it's not yet done
	correctly. Suspend fullscreen when neccessary. Save resources
	on exit, if it's enabled. Removed not used code, it was just
	confusing.

	content of the framebuffer on fullscreen changes, so colors stay
	correct even when changing to different bitdepths...

	frame buffer area which are used for sprites...

	desktop color scheme when on an 8 bit desktop or you switch
	to an application which redefines the palette, colors will go
	bad...

	dd_object2, client_width, client_height added to canvas_t struct.
