 *  \brief  Headless UI statusbar stuff
 *
 *  The status bar widget is part of every machine window. This widget
 *  reacts to UI notifications from the emulation core and otherwise
 *  does not interact with the rest of the main menu.
 *
 *  Functions described as "Statusbar API functions" are called by the
 *  rest of the UI or the emulation system itself to report that the
 *  status displays must be updated to reflect possibly new
 *  information. It is not necessary for the data to be truly new; the
 *  statusbar implementation will treat repeated reports of the same
 *  state as no-ops when necessary for performance.
