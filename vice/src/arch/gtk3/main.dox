  \section  intro_sec   Introduction

  Welcome to the Gtk3 API documentation of VICE. These pages will provide some
  information and code examples on how to write VICE Gtk3 UI code. Writing Gtk3
  UI code will require some knowledge of Gtk3, but normally using some widgets
  from the `src/gtk3/widgets/base` directory will go a long way. Just
  \code{.c}
    #include "vice_gtk3.h"
  \endcode
  And you should be good to go. This will include the gtk3 headers and the
  headers of VICE base widgets/dialogs.

  \section  base_widgets    VICE Gtk3 base widgets

  The VICE Gtk3 UI has a few widgets and dialogs that make working with
  resources or files much easier.

  For example, instead of writing custom code to connect a GtkCheckButton to
  a boolean resources, there is a widget that connects a resource to a
  GtkCheckButton: \ref resourcecheckbutton.c. It handles retrieving the resource
  value, updating it, reverting to the orignal value, etc.

  \subsection   base_widgets_list   Available base widgets

  At the time of writing (2018-08-01), the following 'resource' widgets are availabe:

  Widget                     | Description
  ---------------------------|---------------
  \ref resourcebrowser.c     | Allows selection of a file, setting a resource
  \ref resourcecheckbutton.c | A GtkCheckButton handling a boolean resource
  \ref resourcecombobox.c    | A GtkComboBox handling either an integer or a string resource
  \ref resourceentry.c       | Text entry, either updating the resource each key press, or only updating the resource when loosing focus or when Enter is pressed
  \ref resourceradiogroup.c  | A set of radio buttons grouped in a GtkGrid, using a key-value approach
  \ref resourcescale.c       | A GtkScale handling a resource
  \ref resourcespinbutton.c  | A GtkSpinButton handling an integer resource, allows using 'fake digits' to pretend a resource is a fixed-point value
  \ref resourceswitch.c      | A GtkSwitch handling a resource, preferably used when a resource indicates an actual switch


  \subsection   base_widgets_api    Base widgets API

  The API for the various resource widgets is fairly simple. Each widget has a
  few 'methods':

  Method    | Description
  ----------|------------
  new()     | Instanciate widget, store current value of resource for later use
  set()     | Set new value for widget, updates resource as well
  get()     | Get resource value of widget (ignores whether the widget is synchronized with its resource, it simply retrieves the current resource value)
  reset()   | Reset widget to the state it was when instanciated
  sync()    | Synchronize widget with its resource value, only usufull when the resource value is altered outside the widget's code
  factory() | Reset widget and resource value to its factory value
  apply()   | Apply the current value of the widget to its resource (in cases where the widget is told *not* to update the resource when the widget's value changes

  \subsection   Examples

  A very simple example, using a boolean resource:

  // Fuck that example, that was completely wrong

  \endcode
