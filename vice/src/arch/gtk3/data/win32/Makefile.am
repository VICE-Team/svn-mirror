# Create Windows .ico files

# Currently the generation of the Windows .res files happens here, I tried to
# do this work in data/common/Makefile.am, so we can use the same files for
# SDL builds, but that didn't quite work out. Probably due to recursive make
# not handling dependencies outside its tree very well (/src vs /data).
