/** \brief Callback for handling mouse motion events over the emulated
 *         screen.
 *
 *  Mouse motion events influence three different subsystems: the
 *  light-pen (if any), the emulated mouse (if any), and the UI-level
 *  routines that hide the mouse pointer if it comes to rest over the
 *  machine's screen.
 *
 *  Moving the mouse pointer resets the number of frames the mouse was
 *  held still.
 *
 *  Light pen position information is computed based on the new mouse
 *  position and what part of the machine window is actually in use
 *  based on current scaling and aspect ratio settings.
 *
 *  Mouse information is computed based on the difference between the
 *  current mouse location and the last recorded mouse location. If
 *  the mouse has been captured by the emulator, this also then warps
 *  the mouse pointer back to the middle of the emulated
 *  screen. (These warps will trigger an additional call to this
 *  function, but an additional flag will prevent them from being
 *  processed as true input.)
 *
 *  Information relevant to these processes is cached in the
 *  video_canvas_s structure for use as needed.
 *
 *  \param widget    The widget that sent the event.
 *  \param event     The GdkEventMotion event itself.
 *  \param user_data The video canvas data structure associated with
 *                   this machine window.
 *  \return TRUE if no further event processing is necessary.
 *
 *  \todo Information involving mouse-warping is not cached with the
 *        canvas yet, and should be for cleaner C128 support.
 *
 *  \todo Pointer warping does not work on Wayland. GTK3 and its GDK
 *        substrate simply do not provide an implementation for
 *        gdk_device_warp(), and Wayland's window model doesn't really
 *        support pointer warping the way GDK envisions. Wayland's
 *        window model envisions using pointer constraints to confine
 *        the mouse pointer within a target window, and then using
 *        relative mouse motion events to capture additional attempts
 *        at motion outside of it. SDL2 implements this and it may
 *        provide a useful starting point for this alternative
 *        implementation.
 *
 * \sa event_box_mouse_button_cb Further light pen and mouse button
 *     handling.
 * \sa event_box_scroll_cb Further mouse button handling.
 * \sa event_box_stillness_tick_cb More of the hide-idle-mouse-pointer
 *     logic.

/** \brief Create a new machine window.
 *
 *  A machine window is a GtkGrid that has a menu bar on top, a status
 *  bar on the bottom, and a renderer-backend specific drawing area in
 *  the middle. The canvas argument has its relevant fields populated
 *  by this process.
 *
 *  \param canvas The video canvas to populate.
 *
 *  \todo At the moment, the renderer backend is selected at compile
 *        time and cannot be changed. It would be nice to be able to
 *        fall back to simpler backends if more specialized ones
 *        fail. This is difficult at present because we cannot know if
 *        OpenGL is available until long after the window is created
 *        and realized.
