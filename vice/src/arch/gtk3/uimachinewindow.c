/** \brief Callback for handling mouse motion events over the emulated
 *         screen.
 *
 *  Mouse motion events influence three different subsystems: the
 *  light-pen (if any), the emulated mouse (if any), and the UI-level
 *  routines that hide the mouse pointer if it comes to rest over the
 *  machine's screen.
 *
 *  Moving the mouse pointer resets the number of frames the mouse was
 *  held still.
 *
 *  Light pen position information is computed based on the new mouse
 *  position and what part of the machine window is actually in use
 *  based on current scaling and aspect ratio settings.
 *
 *  Mouse information is computed based on the difference between the
 *  current mouse location and the last recorded mouse location. If
 *  the mouse has been captured by the emulator, this also then warps
 *  the mouse pointer back to the middle of the emulated
 *  screen. (These warps will trigger an additional call to this
 *  function, but an additional flag will prevent them from being
 *  processed as true input.)
 *
 *  Information relevant to these processes is cached in the
 *  video_canvas_s structure for use as needed.
 *
 *  \param widget    The widget that sent the event.
 *  \param event     The GdkEventMotion event itself.
 *  \param user_data The video canvas data structure associated with
 *                   this machine window.
 *  \return TRUE if no further event processing is necessary.
 *
 *  \todo Information involving mouse-warping is not cached with the
 *        canvas yet, and should be for cleaner C128 support.
 *
 *  \todo Pointer warping does not work on Wayland. GTK3 and its GDK
 *        substrate simply do not provide an implementation for
 *        gdk_device_warp(), and Wayland's window model doesn't really
 *        support pointer warping the way GDK envisions. Wayland's
 *        window model envisions using pointer constraints to confine
 *        the mouse pointer within a target window, and then using
 *        relative mouse motion events to capture additional attempts
 *        at motion outside of it. SDL2 implements this and it may
 *        provide a useful starting point for this alternative
 *        implementation.
 *
 * \sa event_box_mouse_button_cb Further light pen and mouse button
 *     handling.
 * \sa event_box_scroll_cb Further mouse button handling.
 * \sa event_box_stillness_tick_cb More of the hide-idle-mouse-pointer
 *     logic.

       that small size for determining the initial position, and if it then resizes after that, the window may
       no more be centered, or even partially off screen.

       To prevent this from happening, we try to set the correct final size here.

       tricks and assumptions. the following also shows shortcomings / problems in other parts of the code.
