 * SDL blocks event polling completely while the window is being resized. However,
 * we can hook new SDL_Events being added to the queue from the context of the thread
 * adding the event. By observing events as they are added, we can note which redraws
 * are ready. In addition, as resize events are queued on the main thread during a resize,
 * we can check if any redraws have been requested and execute them at that point, rather
 * than waiting for the event polling to unfreeze.
