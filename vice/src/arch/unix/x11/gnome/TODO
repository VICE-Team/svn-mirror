Missing features
- Drag'n'Drop support
- Session Management

Known Bugs (help is appreciated !):
- Gnome/GTK+ commandline is ignored.

Things, which will change (don't ask when!):
- Tape status widget (.TAP vs .t64) handling is lousy.
- Monitor GUI
- VIC20 Cartridge attach heuristic for image pairs
- More standard Gnome'ish menus.

- Gnome 1 - NOT supported anymore (starting with VICE-1.20).
	    Vice-1.19 the last officially supported Gnome1/Gtk1 version.

- Gnome 2
To compile the gnome2/gtk2 version use configure option
`--enable-gnomeui'.

To compile this version you need to have certain gnome2/gtk2 devel
packages installed. 

The port is known to work pretty well on recent Linux desktops with
GTK+/Gnome featured libraries.
