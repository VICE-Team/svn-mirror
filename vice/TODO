What are we going to do next
============================

Important notice: we are sorry but we really cannot keep up with the
x128 development.  x128 (the C128 emulator, that was included in VICE
0.10.0 and 0.11.0) will not be maintained any longer, though we would
like it to be.  If you feel like you can help the project and keep
x128 alive, you are of course welcome to send your contributions.
(Notice that `our' x128 has nothing to do with the X128 ZX-Spectrum
Emulator, whose name was chosen independently.)

* General improvements
----------------------

  - More ports!  (E.g. MacOS, Win32, BeOS, PSX, N64...)  Any
    volunteers?

  - Better built-in monitor and improved XDebugger.  These two
    could/should also be integrated.

  - Snapshot format to freeze the emulators' state.  The main issue is
    to make it as implementation-independent as possible, so that
    snapshots made with the current versions will still run on the
    future ones.

  - "True" P00 support with the real names.

  - Support for cartridges.

  - Ability to emulate key presses e.g. via cut & paste, command-line
    options, or menus.  This can be done by writing to the keyboard
    buffer or by changing the values in the keyboard port.

  - Code cleanup (work is in progress, but it's still a bit
    ugly-looking in several places).

  - Convert all the documentation to texinfo, so that it can be
    translated to different formats more easily.

  - Write real MS-DOS documentation (any volunteers?).

  - FS-based drive emulation on any serial device, not just #11.

  - Allow tape loading without the virtually pressed "Play" button,
    which can break some programs that do not like this.

  - Better mapping from OS/language specific keyboard drivers to the
    emulator keyboard.  Possibly configurable at runtime.

  - Emulate shifted keys more accurately by delaying the shifted key
    after the shift.

  - Emulate the RESTORE key more accurately.

  - Better support for alternative ROM sets.

* C64 improvements
------------------

  - Faster and (maybe) cycle-exact SID (the current version is
    sample-accurate).

  - Better handling for REU load/save.  It would be nice to have a few
    menu entries to do this.

  - More accurate REU emulation, with 16 Mbyte mode.

  - 1351 mouse emulation, at least on MS-DOS.

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

  - Ability to change the memory configuration at Run-time.

  - Warn about disabling/enabling true1541 in the middle of loading.

  - Better, possibly cycle-based, emulation of the VIC-I chip.

  - More accurate VIA chip emulation.

  - Improve the accuracy of the audio emulation.

  - Tape support.

* PET improvements
------------------

  - Complete CRTC emulation.

  - Support for different models at runtime.

  - More accurate VIA chip emulation.

  - Better sound emulation.

  - Tape support.

* 1541 improvements
-------------------

  - More accurate VIA chip emulation.

  - Emulate more than just one 1541 drive with the "true" emulation.
