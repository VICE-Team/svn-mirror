What are we going to do next
============================

* General improvements
----------------------

  - Better docs!

  - More ports (E.g. BeOS...)  Any volunteers?  MacOS and Win32 ports
    are in the works; if you want to help, please let us know.

  - Snapshot format to freeze the emulators' state.  The main issue is
    to make it as implementation-independent as possible, so that
    snapshots made with the current versions will still run on the
    future ones.

  - Convert all the documentation to texinfo, so that it can be
    translated to different formats more easily.

  - Write real MS-DOS documentation (any volunteers?).

  - Allow tape loading without the virtually pressed "Play" button,
    which can break some programs that do not like it to be pressed
    (e.g. Turbo Assembler).

  - Emulate shifted keys more accurately by delaying the shifted key
    after the shift.

  - Emulate the RESTORE key more accurately.

  - Better support for alternative ROM sets.

  - Some more kernal patches, for instance for changing colors and
    patching the reset routine to make it faster (maybe configurable).

* C64 improvements
------------------

  - Faster and (maybe) cycle-exact SID (the current version is
    sample-accurate).

  - Better handling for REU load/save.  It would be nice to have a few
    menu entries to do this.

  - More accurate REU emulation, with 16 Mbyte mode.

* C128 improvements
-------------------

  - Support missing keys (Caps Lock, 40/80 Display).

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

  - Better, possibly cycle-based, emulation of the VIC-I chip.

  - Improve the accuracy of the audio emulation.

* PET improvements
------------------

  - Complete CRTC emulation.

* 1541 improvements
-------------------

  - Emulate more than just one 1541 drive with the "true" emulation.
