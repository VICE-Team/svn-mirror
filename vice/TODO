What are we going to do next
============================

* General improvements
----------------------

- Write real MS-DOS documentation (any volunteers?).

- Allow tape loading without the virtually pressed "Play" button,
  which can break some programs that do not like it to be pressed
  (e.g. Turbo Assembler).

- Emulate shifted keys more accurately by delaying the shifted key
  after the shift.

- Emulate the RESTORE key more accurately.

- Better support for alternative ROM sets. (-> in the works)

- Some more Kernal patches, for instance for changing colors and
  patching the reset routine to make it faster (maybe configurable).

- Filtering video output to make it look more like an old monitor or
  a TV set. (-> done (on Unix) with palettes?)

- More ports.  Any volunteers?  An Acorn RISC-OS port and an OS2 port
  are in the works; if you want to help, please let us know.

* C64 improvements
------------------

- Better handling for REU load/save.  It would be nice to have a few
  menu entries to do this.

- More accurate REU emulation, with 16 Mbyte mode.

- Fix Emulator test suite (CPUPORT and CIA are still broken in this respect)

* C128 improvements
-------------------

- Support missing keys (Caps Lock, 40/80 Display).

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

- Better, possibly cycle-based, emulation of the VIC-I chip.

- Improve the accuracy of the audio emulation.

* PET improvements
------------------

* CBM-II improvements
------------------

* Plus/4
--------

- Implement a Plus/4 emulator.



This is our wishlist for long-term development 
==============================================

* General improvements
----------------------

* C64 improvements
------------------

* C128 improvements
-------------------

- VDC emulation, i.e. 2MHz/80 cols modes. 

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

* PET improvements
------------------

- SuperPET 6809 emulation.
  (GPLd 6809 emulation? trap to reset 6502 CPU only but not I/O, to return 
  from 6809 mode)

- cycle-based CRTC emulation (currently somewhat line-based but working
  quite well).

* CBM-II improvements
------------------

- C5x0 emulation (Like C6x0, but with VIC-II video chip)
  (non-(C64-)compatible mapping of pixel/char data for the VIC-II,
  halting CPU is different from C64)

- cycle-based CRTC emulation (currently somewhat line-based but working
  quite well).

* KIM-1
--------

- Implement a KIM-1 emulator.
  (needs 6530/6532 emulation and a 6-digit 7-segment display.
